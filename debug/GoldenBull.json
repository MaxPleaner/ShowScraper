Their music features many sounds of late ‘90s-early 2000s’ pop-punk alongside many contemporary elements. The group was originally formed by singer Joshua Latham and guitarist JP Brown while they were classmates at Jesuit High School. Fellow classmate Dominick Conforte was enlisted to play the bass, and the current lineup was solidified years later with the addition of drummer Ray-Ray Boudreoux in 2018. Shortly after releasing their first single, ‘Out of Formality’ (2017), the group would embark on their first tour across the southeastern U.S, sponsored by entertainment platform Old Row. The following years’ release of ‘Yellow Suitcase’ was a success, garnering significant playlist and radio attention for the group. As their fanbase began to expand beyond their region, the band began to include portions of the east coast in their tours. Perfect Spiral was released in 2019 and was well received by fans, attracting the attention of a number of labels. The band released their fourth single, “Bed Sweats”, through New Orleans’ based Orange Music Records in the fall of 2019. On January 10th, 2020, Neutral Snap released their debut album “Sorry, I Passed Out” to positive reviews and strong fan support.\nTOWNIES are a trio of friends with their own unique brand of intoxicating emo-tinged punk, affectionately known as “broc rock\". They met in 2016 as summer camp counselors in rural New Hampshire, where they would perform pop punk covers to hundreds of equally mystified and terrified children. After three summers of honing their craft, Townies burst onto the New England underground scene, playing basements and bars throughout the greater Boston area. 2020 saw the release of their first EP, “Such \u0026 Spit,” described by punknews.org as “sincere, emotionally complex pop-punk with an any-genre-will-do-for-a-moment attitude.” The band has since relocated to Los Angeles, where they are writing and performing regularly. Their sophomore EP “BROC.\" was released in May 2022 via in-house label SEVENTY/THIRTY MUSIC. They are currently writing material for their first full-length LP.\nSORRY GHOST - a potent blend of optimism and frustration, loud and soft edges, encouragement and rejection. Childhood best friends brought together in the swampy lands of Louisiana, Matt and Dan moved to Los Angeles and added the dynamic Tate Silver and Sean Duong to complete the package. Dan is the spice to Matt's sizzle, the goof to his swagger. Tate brings the midwestern charm and highfalutin theater training from the likes of Julliard, while Sean brings the youthful energy and zest for life that only he can. This unlikely crew is setting out to blend the alt rock/indie vibes that made Matt the smooth operator he is today, the pop punk sounds that soothed Dan's teen angst, the easy going groove of Tate's jazzed-filled youth, and the soft boy emo anthems of Sean's adolescence. With new music in the works, Sorry Ghost invites you to join them as they stumble through all the feels, reminding you to stop and smell the fun.
