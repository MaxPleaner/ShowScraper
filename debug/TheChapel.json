All original tickets remain valid. \nBedouine, a gallicized riff on bedouin, the nomad, the wanderer. Anyone can assume such a name, but Azniv Korkejian has an experience of what it means, the type of ground it covers. “Moving around so much caused me at some point to feel displaced, to not really belong anywhere and I thought that was a good title.” Her development was shaped by political landscapes and family opportunities, her adult life patterned by paths of her own. Born in Aleppo, Syria to Armenian parents, Korkejian spent her childhood in Saudi Arabia, moving to America when her family won a Green Card lottery. They settled in Boston, then Houston, but she split for L.A. as soon as she could. A casual offer to stay on a horse farm took her to the rolling hills of Lexington, Kentucky, followed by a year in Austin, and a trip east to Savannah for a degree in sound design. Returning to L.A., she discovered a close-knit community of musicians in Echo Park that started to feel like home. Maybe America is just a highway that leads back to L.A.\nKorkejian works with sound professionally, in dialogue editing and music editing, a slice of Hollywood’s sprawling industry. She never set out to be a singer in L.A., taking a zen approach to that part of her life, thinking that if it happens, it happens. “I just kept meeting the right people, who were professional musicians, and even though they were going on these big legitimate tours, they were still coming back to this amazing small scene, still demoing at home, and I immediately felt welcomed to join in on that. L.A. actually made me less jaded.” One day she walked into the studio of bass player / producer Gus Seyffert (Beck, Norah Jones, The Black Keys) to inquire about portable reel-to-reel tape machines and ended up cutting “Solitary Daughter in a first take. So they began another kind of journey.\nBedouine has a sound. Sixties folk meets seventies country-funk with a glimmer of bossa nova cool. Lithe guitar picking and precise lyrical excursions. That mesmerizing voice and phrasing. Working on around thirty tracks over three years, with contributions from a remarkable cast of players like guitarist Smokey Hormel (Tom Waits, Joe Strummer, Johnny Cash), Seyffert and Korkejian brought a selection of ten songs to Richmond, Virginia. She specifically sought out Spacebomb, approaching Matthew E. White after a show in L.A. He remembers listening to the song she sent over and over, on and off the road, “‘One of These Days’ became our alarm when we woke up for almost all of that tour.” Anticipating this future collaboration, the tracks were created with breathing room for the Spacebomb touch and Trey Pollard’s sinuous symphonic arrangements. Back in California, Thom Monahan (Pernice Brothers, Devendra Banhart, Vetiver) brought all the elements together in a masterful final mix.\nEschewing notions of nomadic chic, Bedouine represents minimalism motivated by travel, paring down and paring down until only the essential remains. Her music establishes a sustained and complete mood, reflecting on the unending reverberations of displacement, unafraid to take pleasure along the way. At the end of “Summer Cold” Korkejian composed an interstitial piece to recreate the sounds of her grandmother’s street in Aleppo. Partly due to America’s role in destabilizing Syria, this sonic memory is the only way to return to her birthplace. Worlds that have been lost might only be accessed through a song, in a line or a melody or a trace of tape, but they must be looked for in order to be found, so she wanders on."},{"date":"2022-06-04T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiYTA3MTYxOTMtMDM2Zi00OTQyLTk3YmYtYTAwZjM4Y2I5MGM0IiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Monophonics","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Monophonics/474710?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$35 advance and $40 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nThe world's premier psychedelic soul band, Monophonics, cordially invites you to attend the grand re-opening of the once thriving, once vibrant establishment, the legendary Sage Motel.

The group had just finished an Outlaw Country Cruise when the pandemic hit and sent them into their homes on lockdown.\nInstead of a triumphant tour marking the illustrious landmark, Farrar was forced indoors by the pandemic, and his “Reverie” during that time helped define Electro Melodier, Son Volt’s 10th studio album – and third for influential Nashville indie Thirty Tigers. The title, taken from the names of two vintage amplifiers from the late ‘40s and early ‘50s, also describes the disc’s unique blend of folk, country, blues, soul and rock – an electric troubadour with melodies that hit and stick. Social protest songs like “Living in the U.S.A.” and “The Globe,” the former about the promises of this nation gone wrong, the latter referencing the street protests accompanying the Black Lives Matter movement, exist side by side with odes to long-term relationships (specifically his 25-year marriage) in “Diamonds and Cigarettes” and “Lucky Ones.” Once again accompanied by the current Son Volt line up – keyboardist/steel guitarist Mark Spencer, bassist Andrew Duplantis, guitarist Chris Frame and drummer Mark Patterson –Farrar takes a slight turn from 2019’s politically pointed Union to a series of songs that asks questions rather than demanding answers – think of “Living in the U.S.A.” as Farrar’s version of Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.,” Neil Young’s “Rockin’ in the Free World” or Patti Smith’s “People Have the Power,” an anthem to unite the populace.\n“I had more time to devote to and concentrate on the writing,” says Farrar about his enforced quarantine. “We were fortunate in that we had just released Union and toured the country, so we were off cycle. It was still a rough year, but as a songwriter, I was able to make the most of it.”\nOne listen to Electro Melodier, which opens with “Reverie,” describing Farrar’s contemplative state gazing out his window, enlivened with Mark Spencer’s “Wichita Lineman” guitar riffs andthe lush Big Star melodies, and you wonder why no other rock ‘n’ roll bands or singer/songwriters are making albums like this about what we’re all going through.\n“I wanted to concentrate on the melodies which got me into music in the first place,” says Farrar. “I wanted politics to take a back seat this time, but it always seems to find a way back in there.”\nListen to the Moog line from The Who’s “Won’t Get Fooled Again” channeled in “The Globe,” or the Led Zeppelin homage in “Someday Is Now,” the nod to gut-bucket Mississippi delta blues in the Lightnin’ Hopkins low-tuned guitar stylings of “War on Misery” or Spencer’s haunting slide on the funereal dirge of “The Levee On Down,” which takes Andrew Jackson to task for everything from the “Trail of Tears” massacre of the Cherokees to his face on the $20 bill instead of Harriet Tubman. The environmentally conscious “Arkey Blue” nods to a honky-tonk in Bandera, TX, Arkey Blue’s Silver Dollar, where Hank Williams, Sr. allegedly carved his name into one of the wood tables, and even quotes Pope Francis on “turbulent rains never before seen.”\n“I’m just asking the same question, how can so much go wrong in a country that is held up as an example to the world of something righteous,” explains Farrar about songs like “Living in the U.S.A.,” in which you can hear doomsaying prophecies like Barry McGuire’s “Eve ofDestruction” set to the guitar riffs of Lou Reed’s “Sweet Jane.”\nStill based in St. Louis (“It kinda makes sense as a central location for touring because all the interstates connect through here”), Farrar was born in Belleville, IL, where he formed Uncle Tupelo with his high school classmate Jeff Tweedy. “We had similar musical interests and took it from there,” says Jay modestly about the groundbreaking group.\nFarrar is grateful to his wife of 25 years, a sentiment which he expresses lovingly on “Diamonds and Cigarettes” – featuring vocals by country singer Laura Cantrell, along with songs like the soulful “Lucky Ones” and “Sweet Refrain,” a song that captures the spirit of Bentonia, Mississippi, home of Skip James along with name checks for local legends Jimmy “Duck” Holmes and the Bluefront Cafe. “These are the Times” was recorded entirely remotely by Zoom, signaling one of the new methods of making music ushered in by Covid.\nWith tour dates scheduled in 2022, Son Volt is ready to return to what they know best after a welcome period of introspection. “It’s a good time to take stock of what’s lost and what’s gained,” said Farrar. “At this point, we’re not even sure what we’re going to get back.”\nThe songs of Electro Melodier help remind us to be thankful of what we still have – new music from Jay Farrar and Son Volt.\n“Daylight brings the clues to the world to life/Make or break gotta do what it takes to survive.” - “Sweet Refrain”"},{"date":"2022-06-09T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiM2QzYjZlYmMtMmY4MC00MDhhLTg2ZGMtNzlkYTIxODMzNWRmIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Woods","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Woods/481321?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$22 advance and $25 day of show\n\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \n\n“Dreaming doesn’t come easy these shadowed days, which is why Strange To Explain by Woods is such a welcome turning of new colors. \nIt presents an extended moment of sweet reflection for the 15-year-old band, bouncing back to earth as something hopeful and weird and resolute. Like everything else they’ve recorded, it sounds exactly like themselves, but with subtly different shades and breaths and rhythmic feels and everything else that changes, the natural march of time and the intentional decisions of the musicians moving in what feels like an uncommonly organic alignment.\nStrange To Explain trades in a different kind of dependability, maintaining a steady connection to the voice on the other side of the record needle. After quickly recording and releasing 2017’s Love Is Love in response to the tumultuous events of their (and our) 2016, Jeremy Earl and company took their time with what came next. Parenthood arrived, as did a short songwriting pause. The band went bicoastal when Jarvis Taveniere headed west. And when they returned to their posts, there on the other side of this particular mirror, they made this, an album that not only catches and holds and shares the light in yet another new way, but recognizes that there’s still light to be caught, which is also no small thing.\nA bend beyond the last bend beyond, Woods keep on changing, thoughtfully and beautifully. The colors were always there, like trees blossoming just slightly differently each season, a synesthetic message coded in slow-motion. Recorded in Stinson Beach, the kind of place that seems like an AI simulation of an idyllic northern California coastal escape, the familiar jangling guitars recede to the background. John Andrews’s warm keyboards and twining Mellotron rise around Earl’s songs and dance across the chord changes like warm sunlight off the Pacific. The music feels a karmic landmass away from the creepiness of the uncanny valley. \nJust dig into “Can’t Get Out” or “Fell So Hard” and it’s easy to spot the affable hooks and fuzzed-out bass and third-eye winks and fun harmonies that Woods have produced reliably since way back ‘round 2004 (which, in the buzz-buzz world of psych-pop really is a grand achievement, too). But listen carefully, also, to the sound of our (and their) world in transition, the ambient humming of spring peepers behind “Where Do You Go When You Dream.” Especially sink into the intention-setting opening trio of songs, emerging from (and shimmering inside) an atmosphere that could only be made by musicians who’ve been working together for nearly 20 years, as Earl and Taveniere have. It’s hardly a secret language, but you try verbalizing it, let alone communicating in it.\nDepending on where in the time-track one stands, it’s their 11th full length (not counting collaborations, split LPs, EPs, and singles), and the 99th release on Earl’s Woodsist label. By any standards, Strange To Explain is the work of a mature band, capable of both heavy atmospheric declarations like “Just To Fall Asleep” and extended-form pieces like the album-closing “Weekend Wind,” unfolding in layers of trumpet and vibraphone and ambient guitars and stereoscopic percussion. There are backwards messages and forward ones, lyrical and otherwise. There are melodies that (at least to me) come back nonlinearly but happily throughout the day when I’m not listening to the music itself, finding some hidden perch and maybe soon transforming into the folk songs of the mind.\nFor contemporary heads, it can be nearly a full-time job to filter out all the bad energy being blasted through nearly all media channels from every conceivable direction. But not all media channels. These benevolent, Mellotron-dabbed dream-sounds constitute some of the more welcome transmissions on these shores in a Venusian minute, just what my kosmik transom was designed to accept. They’re sure to brighten any desert solarium, LED-lit pod, portable Bucky-dome, eco-fit Airstream, or whatever other cozy dwelling your time-mind is currently occupying.” – Jesse Jarnow"},{"date":"2022-06-10T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiMTBmZjZmOTktZDk5Yi00OGI2LTgxZTctZWNkYWZjMGQyNGU3IiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Chali 2na \u0026 Cut Chemist","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Chali-2naandCutChemist/477495?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$35 advance and $40 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nChali 2na and Cut Chemist have been inseparable for 35 years.

Although J5 was in full swing making music and doing shows, Chali and Cut also were founding members of the fusion Latin group Ozomatli in 1995. Since then the two have been busy with both groups and still managed to find time to separate and embark in solo careers on the side. Cut Chemist went on to do remixes and features for such acts as DJ Shadow, Less Than Jake and Blackalicious. Chali also explored his rap prowess with such acts as Roots Manuva, Lyrics Born, Slightly Stoopid and Galactic just to name a few. Separately they also landed solo deals with Interscope and Warner Brothers.\nFor the last three years they’ve been doing a special collaborative performance that tells the story of their lives in music together.

Timeless and salient, these themes echo throughout the fifth album from Midlake, their first since Antiphon in 2013. Produced to layered, loving perfection by John Congleton, For the Sake of Bethel Woods is an album of immersive warmth and mystery from a band of ardent seekers, one of our generation’s finest: a band once feared lost themselves by fans, perhaps, but here revivified with freshness and constancy of intent.\nFrom the cover to the title and beyond, a longing to reconnect with that which seems lost and seek purpose in its passing sits at the record’s core. The cover star is keyboardist/flautist Jesse Chandler’s father, who, tragically, passed away in 2018. As singer Eric Pulido explains, “He was a lovely human, and it was really heavy and sad, and he came to Jesse in a dream. I reference it in a song. He said, ‘Hey, Jesse, you need to get the band back together.’ I didn’t take that lightly. We had already had these feelings with everyone in the band of, oh, this could be a cool thing to do. But the dream was a kind of beautiful depiction of a purpose to reconvene and make music together as friends.”\nFeaturing Chandler’s father during John Sebastian’s set, the cover image was taken from the 1970 documentary Woodstock. In 1969, Jesse’s then-16-year-old dad had joined a friend and hitchhiked from Ridgewood, New Jersey, to the legendary festival. Raised in Woodstock after his father moved there in 1981, Jesse later paid pilgrimage to Bethel Woods with his father; there, the elder Chandler recorded an audio account of his festival experience in the museum’s public database. “So for me, the picture of that kid, my dad, forever frozen in time,” says Chandler, “encapsulates what it means to be in the throes of impressionable and fleeting youth, and all that the magic of music, peace, love and communion bring to it, whether one knows it at the time or not. (I think he knew it).”\nA desire to commune with the past and connect with present, lived experience asserts itself from the opening of the album. A song that resonates with Midlake’s return and, perhaps, our lockdown era, ‘Commune’ can also be read in terms of a deeper urge to re-engage with sometimes neglected ideals and beliefs. ‘Bethel Woods’ sustains and develops that reconnection, evoking the steadfast and contemplative urgency of The Trials of Van Occupanther to back a lyric steeped in yearning for a paradisal time and place of hope and optimism. Soaring guitars and atmospheric noise effects extend a sonic scope further developed by ‘Glistening,’ where arpeggios dance like light glancing off a lake. In just three songs, Midlake reintroduce themselves and reach out into fresh territory with a richly intuitive dynamism, honoring their past as a seedbed of possibility.\nThe psychedelic space-rock and sticky guitars of ‘Exile’ shift the album to another plane, promising rich returns live, before ‘Feast of Carrion’ splices apocalyptic imagery with lustrous harmonies: darkness and light, held in rarefied balance. A deeply personal turn follows on ‘Noble,’ a song of tender innocence named after drummer McKenzie Smith’s infant son, born with a rare brain disorder called Semi-Lobar Holoprosencephaly. Pulido, who has been friends with McKenzie since they were 16 years old, kept McKenzie in mind for the lyrics. “I wrote the song from his perspective in a way, his expression to me of how he had been feeling towards his son. And then among the lament of his condition, it’s also embracing this child who has only joy. Noble doesn’t know that he has a condition, he just loves life. And smiles, and is so innocent, and perfect in so many ways.”\nElsewhere, the prog-enhanced funk-rock of ‘Gone’ seeks to find hope in relationships that seem fragile. The ELO-esque ‘Meanwhile...’ draws inspiration from what happened when Midlake paused after Antiphon, developing universal resonance as a song about the beautiful growths that can emerge from the cracks and gaps between things. ‘Dawning’ draws on 1970s soft-rock stylings for another song searching for hope, its keyboard line reaching out towards an uncertain future while everything seems to collapse around it; ‘The End’ reflects on the difficulties of partings. Finally, ‘Of Desire’ meditates on letting go of what you can’t control and attending to what you can during uncertain times. “It’s about finding peace in that humbling,” says Pulido. “Sometimes it’s hard to have a large effect, so it’s just about shrinking that and saying, these are the things I can do and the rest is to be seen, to be known.”\nMidlake began re-attending to their patch in 2019, with the bulk of the album’s work undertaken when the world shut down in 2020. The lockdown turned out to be helpful, in terms of offering an escape from grim reality and focusing the band’s energies – essential for an outfit whose members (Pulido, Chandler, Smith, Eric Nichelson and Joey McClellan) had all pursued alternative ventures following Antiphon. Also on-hand was new collaborator John Congleton, who produced, engineered and mixed the album, marking Midlake’s first record with an outside producer. “I can’t say enough just how much his influence brought our music to another sonic place then we would have,” says Pulido. “I don’t want to record without a producer again. Part of that is the health of the band, because as you get older you get more opinionated and you kind of need that person who says, ‘No, it’s going to be this way!’ It’s hard to do that with your friends.”\nThe result is a powerful, warming expression of resolve and renewal for Midlake, opening up new futures for the band and honoring their storied history. Formed in the small town of Denton, with roots in the University of North Texas College of Music, Midlake delivered an auspicious debut with 2004’s Bamnan and Slivercork. For the follow-up, they looked further afield and deeper within to deliver 2006’s wondrous The Trials of Van Occupanther, a modern classic pitched between 1871, 1971 and somewhere out of time: between Henry David Thoreau and Neil Young’s After the Gold Rush, between 1970s Laurel Canyon thinking and a longing for something more mysterious.\nConfidence bolstered by a growing fanbase and a developed sense of their own far- reaching abilities, Midlake – a band acutely attuned to seasonal shifts – then embraced change. In 2010, they visited darker psych-folk thickets for The Courage of Others and backed John Grant on his lustrously spiky breakthrough album, Queen of Denmark. When singer Tim Smith departed Midlake in 2012, Pulido stepped up to the lead vocal role for 2013’s freshly exploratory Antiphon, teasing out singular routes through vintage electric-folk pastures.\nSince then, domestic projects have beckoned as children entered various band- members’ lives. Pulido joined Bob Dylan’s 75th birthday celebrations at Nashville’s prestigious Ryman Auditorium and launched the project BNQT with a cast of all-star guests, backed by Chandler, McClellan and Smith; Pulido and Chandler also recorded solo albums.\nIn reuniting, the bandmates were adamant that Midlake needed their absolute focus. The result is an album of tremendously engaged thematic and sonic reach with a warm, wise sense of intimacy at its heart: an album to break bread and commune with, honor the past and travel onwards with. In ‘Bethel Woods’, Pulido sings of gathering seeds. On For the Sake of Bethel Woods, those seeds are lovingly nurtured, taking rich and spectacular bloom."},{"date":"2022-06-13T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiYjY1ODE2YWQtY2FlMC00MDU2LTk2ZWMtYmZmZDA1NjAyODk5IiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Bobby Oroza","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Bobby-Oroza/481512?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$20 advance and $25 day of show\n\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nAfter years of grinding as a sideman in the Finnish music scene, Bobby Oroza has stepped up to make his voice heard. Always with an air of crude romanticism, Bobby pushes towards an expression transcending the borders of soul and rock balladry. His dark and intimate debut single ”This Love” didn’t take long to reach the ears and hearts of a worldwide soul music community and is already a proper classic amongst the lowrider and soul collector scenes. \nBobby was born in Helsinki, Finland into a family of musicians and artists. During frequent family parties Bobby´s Bolivian grandfather would pick up a guitar and sing Latin canciones and Cuban classics. Bobby´s mother is a singer and his father a gypsy-style jazz guitarist. All his siblings work in show business and music. As a kid, Bobby was lucky to grow up surrounded by his parents’ record collection which included early jazz and blues, Motown hits, gospel ensembles, and doo-wop groups like The Drifters and The Clovers. The Soul records were balanced out by Brazilian ones, African ones, his mother’s collection of North and South American folk songs, and Nuyorican Salsa albums. All of these influences show up in Bobby’s music. \nBobby started working professionally as a musician in his early teens. His main instruments are guitar and percussion. Before finishing high school Bobby decided he needed to experience the rhythmic source that had inspired him the most, and travelled to Santiago, Cuba.

The original members reformed in 2009.\nFormed in Colchester, Essex, England, in 1979 by Robbie Grey (vocals), Gary McDowell (guitar, vocals), and Michael Conroy (bass, vocals), Modern English were originally known as The Lepers. The group expanded to \"Modern English\" when Richard Brown (drums) and Stephen Walker (keyboards) were subsequently added to the line-up of the band.\nAfter a single on their own 'Limp' label in 1979, the band signed to 4AD the following year, with two further singles released, and a session for John Peel recorded before the band's debut album, Mesh \u0026 Lace, in 1981, the band in the early days showing a strong Joy Division influence. A second Peel session was recorded in October 1981. The follow-up, After The Snow (April 1982), was more keyboard-oriented and was compared to Simple Minds and Duran Duran. It was also released in the United States by Sire Records the following year, where it reached number 70 on the Billboard chart, and sold over 500,000 copies. Grey said of the album, \"We used to think 'God, we'll never make a pop record. We're artists!', but things don't always turn out as you planned and when you actually create a pop record, it's so much more of a thrill than anything else.\" The second single from the album was also a hit in the US, the jangly \"I Melt With You\" reaching number 78. When he reviewed the album, Johnny Waller of Sounds described the track as \"A dreamy, creamy celebration of love and lust, which deserves to be showcased on as 12\" single all by itself, with no b-side,\" while his colleague Tony Mitchell described it as \"suburban amateurism at its most unrewarding.\" The band relocated to New York City and worked on a third album, Ricochet Days, which again made the top 100 in the US, after which the band left 4AD and were solely signed to Sire. The single \"Stop Start\" (1986) was the last record Modern English record released by Sire, the band splitting up.\nGrey and Conroy along with Modern English worked with This Mortal Coil before re-forming Modern English with Mick Conroy and Aaron Davidson for a new album in 1990, Pillow Lips, now on the American TVT label. The album featured a re-recorded \"I Melt With You,\" which was released as a single, and saw the band again in the Billboard top 100. The band split up for a second time in 1991, after contractual problems with TVT, with Grey forming Engine. In 1995, with the legal issues with TVT sorted out, Engine evolved into the next incarnation of Modern English and signed to the Imago label, with Grey and Matthew Shipley (keyboards). This line-up recorded the 1996 album Everything Is Mad.\nRobbie Grey toured the US with a new Modern English lineup coast to coast across the US and recorded a new album with Hugh Jones (producer of I Melt With You). The songs written with guitarist Steven Walker and other members came together on the road and back home in London between tours, after a few years on the shelf this collection of songs was released in May 2010 called \"Soundtrack,\" along side the reissued and remastered \"Stop Start\" album also released at the same time. The original members reunited \u0026 reformed in 2009.\nAfter reforming with original band members and extensive touring, Modern English released their first new album in 30 years, \"Take Me To The Trees\" was finally released in 2016. In 2020 the band had planned to tour and play their 40th Anniversary Tour Worldwide, but the global pandemic had different plans. Modern English played the whole After The Snow album virtually online in its entirety throughout 2020. 2022 looks exciting, as Modern English are in the studio working on brand new material.

Alongside the announcement Daniel has released lead single, \"Shadow in the Frame.\"\nThe landscape surrounding You Belong There is Daniel Rossen’s sophisticated and visceral consideration of what comes after the restless enthusiasm and public fanfare of your youth. It's a riveting 10-song reintroduction to a voice that sounds both entirely familiar and fully re-energized by the act of unfettered expression and newfound self-sovereignty. These songs explore the personally uncharted territory of adulthood, including the troubles left behind and the possibilities that wait ahead. Pre-order You Belong There here: https://warp.ffm.to/youbelongthere\nIn support of the new record, Daniel Rossen is embarking on a 34-date North America and Europe tour this spring. \nFor nearly two decades, Rossen had been a crucial component of Grizzly Bear, whose shared harmonies and interlaced textures reimagined music of the early aughts. He is also a founding member of the acclaimed folk and electronica outfit Department of Eagles. Rossen left the close-knit nest of Brooklyn many years ago, first for an isolated patch of land in upstate New York and then for Santa Fe, where he slowly built the world that is You Belong There largely in his high desert home. Rossen bought himself an upright bass (one of his instruments as a kid), along with the cello and performed almost all of the parts on the album himself, with Chris Bear of Grizzly Bear contributing as a rare guest on “Tangle.” Best known as a guitarist, Rossen took up woodwinds, too, buying several cheap student models and learning just enough to understand the rudiments. \nYou Belong There follows Rossen’s 2012 EP, Silent Hour/Golden Mile, critically acclaimed and rated an 8.0 by Pitchfork, who called it a “majestic song cycle full of fingerpicked notes that babble like tributaries.”"},{"date":"2022-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiZGVlYTc5OTItMGNmZi00YTQyLTgyZTYtMmQzODQwMDkzYWU0IiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Jenny and the Mexicats","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Jenny-andtheMexicats/465682?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$25 advance and $28 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nA fusion of nationalities and personalities, the band's story is a little unusual and more of an accidental occurrence rather than a planned adventure. Jenny \u0026 The Mexicats began life as Pachucos y la Princesa in June 2008, when Jenny was invited to Spain by a Double Bass player (Icho) she'd met two years previously whilst touring in Madrid. In search of something new, Jenny fell right into place in Spain, decided she wanted to call it home and set about starting a band. Icho contacted the best guitar player he knew - Pantera, a flamenco guitarist, whom Icho had known all his life and shared previous bands with, including a a Rockabilly band in Spain. The closest thing to a drummer they could find was David, the Spanish Cajon player extraordinaire, whom Pantera had played with in a Flamenco band. Thrown together in the midst of an English girl's urge for adventure, Jenny \u0026 The Mexicats were born. \nTheir first gig was to be Wonderland, a small annual festival in the UK that raises money for cancer research, where Jenny had previously performed solo. .... Their musical roots had variety and spice and Jenny immediately fell in love with the combination of Flamenco, Acoustic Folk and Rockabilly and began writing constantly. They rehearsed nonstop for two months in the same Flamenco tablao they had met in, Jenny spoke no Spanish and David no English so it was left down to the universal love for creating music and some expert translating from the two Mexicans to bring it all together..... In England Jenny \u0026 The Mexicats created an immediate buzz and it was starting to look as though they may have stumbled across something special. They returned to Spain and continued in the same manner in which they had begun. They began booking more and more gigs and touring the whole of Spain. \nAfter a brief spell signed to an English record label Jenny and the Mexicats decided that in order to protect their sound and to be able to grow in a more natural way, they wanted to be independant and so Mexicat Records was born. In 2012 they moved to Mexico city and released their first album 'JENNY AND THE MEXICATS' which included a mix of English and Spanish songs. Some classics from the bands earlier days like Heaven knows and Starting Something, and had 3 hits on the radio, Verde Mas Alla, ME Voy a Ir and Flor. For high numbers sales, this independant band went Gold with their first album and just recently released their second album 'Ome' en autumn 2014. Ome is a fantastic fusion of rhythms, that varies from feel good dance-able songs to moments of sensitive and timeless musical expression. The nature of the instruments and way of composing of Jenny and the Mexicats opens a lot of doors to switch between genres and be able play whatever they feel in that moment and makes for some very fun live shows.\nIn Ome, the first single is Labios, a song chosen for the soundtrack of Amor de Mis Amores, directed by Manolo Caro. In Frenetico Ritmo and Boulevard they recorded Tuba, and you begin to notice a Mexican influence. J\u0026TM covered a Mexican classic called No Dejes de Quererme and mixed English and Spanish in this version, that was so popular that they have just been invited to sing it with La Sonora Santanera in their latest material. The voice of David shines in Duele a Caminar, Labios and Boulevard and an essence of Inglaterra can truely be heard in Head in My Heart and Back to Basics. The latter of which Jenny recorded alone with her guitar. There is a song dedicated to the bands dogs, 'Sasha y Esteban' and included is 'Even it Out', a classic earlier song from the band that many wished to hear in their first record but was not recorded till the second."},{"date":"2022-06-17T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiMmMzMzVjM2EtZTZmZi00OWM3LTk4OGYtZjFlYzY1ZWE0NWY3IiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Joe Henry","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Joe-Henry/470297?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$22 advance and $25 day of show\nNOTE: This show does not have an opener\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nThis is a partially seated show.

His ninth full-length album, Tip of the Sphere, is available now on ANTI- Records.\nTip of the Sphere follows 2016’s Mangy Love. For that record, McCombs made his television debut on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and was featured in The New York Times’ Sunday Arts \u0026 Leisure section. It was named a “Best Rock Album of the Year” by Pitchfork, featured in the Washington Post’s “Best Music of 2016,” plus many other best of 2016 lists, and was his overall most critically praised album.\nWhile most of McCombs albums have been pieced together in different studios over an extended period of time, Tip of the Sphere was recorded quickly and with a strong sense of purpose at Shahzad Ismaily’s Figure 8 Studios in Brooklyn. This new approach for McCombs brought his songs a raw immediacy and a special balance of compassion and experimentation with the intent of making a more consistent statement. The rock songs have more fervor, the ballads are more beautiful, the explorations more confident; the sounds of jazz and Latin music creep in through the back window. Engineered by Sam Owens (aka Sam Evian), Tip of the Sphere features the core band of McCombs (guitar, vocals), Dan Horne (bass), Otto Hauser (drums) and Frank LoCrasto (piano, organ, and more), plus a range of guests.\nTip of the Sphere recounts what has unfolded in the wake of Mangy Love’s pre-inaugural prophetic themes. It presents an artist trying to make sense of it all through a relentless, ever searching creative process. Throughout Tip of the Sphere, McCombs floats through a suite of songs driven by a journeying mysticism and dark grace. The thematic centerpiece of the album, “Sleeping Volcanoes,” is a rousing, rock and roll number that uses a distinct lyrical approach to intensify the narrative. On the main refrain, a key phrase of the song is repeated continuously and taken through its possible meanings, almost like a jazz musician repeating a musical phrase through key and chord changes. As described by McCombs, “Sleeping Volcanoes” is about “people passing each other on the sidewalk unaware of the emotional volatility they are brushing past, like a sleeping volcano that could erupt at any moment.”\nThe ‘Castillo de la Esfera’ is featured inside the vinyl edition of Tip of the Sphere. ‘The ‘Castillo de la Esfera‘ was created by fellow Northern California artist and contemporary Tahiti Pehrson's an homage to Brion Gysin’s dream machine.

We were just kids playing the music we listened to, and punk rock was the soundtrack to our lives. By the time it evolved and grew to where we were putting out records, life had changed and we were ready to lay it down, and we didn’t know if that would be forever or when we’d pick it back up again.”\nAs it turns out, 2021 would be the year Deviates picked up their instruments again — and now they’re back with a renewed fire inside of them.\nThe band’s third album, Holding Out, is a seven-song blast of SoCal punk rock new and old. A combination of recently written tunes alongside tracks created in the early 2000s for Deviates’ ill-fated original attempt at a third album, the South Bay punks’ latest work fuses every bit of melodic aggression that put the band on the cusp of stardom their first go-around with the more intelligent and mature approach that only decades of life experience can provide.\nBut while Barbara and the band may look and sound a little different now than they did in their early 20s, they’re still fueled by the same rage that fired them up before their 2002 breakup. They’re jumping right back into the spotlight this fall with shows featuring the likes of Pennywise and Dead Kennedys, and they’re more appreciative than ever of the friends, fans, and overall scene that continued to support them through their multi-decade hiatus.\nThis time around, they’ve got the added blessings of no longer being dumb kids and not having stratospheric expectations or external pressures on the band. As full-grown adults with other careers and families, Deviates is only reuniting because they want to — both for themselves and for everyone who’s been waiting for this moment. It’s a level of freedom the band never knew in their first run, and it has them more excited to perform and create than ever before. Much like how punk rock has continued to persist and reach generation after generation of disgruntled youths regardless of what’s popular on the radio, the group carries a renewed passion for both the music and the people around them — regardless of if they’re old fans or ones that discovered them in the interim.\n“Twenty years later, you think you’ll never do it again, but I honestly never stopped writing and never stopped documenting music — and it always ended up going back to punk rock,” Barbara says. “I was 16 when we started this and I'm 42 now, but there’s always been this common thread for Deviates, which is that we’ve always been representative of the crowd that we play in front of. Twenty years later the heart behind this hasn’t changed.”"},{"date":"2022-06-22T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiNTg0ZTE2ZmEtMWY4ZC00OWVkLTgyYzEtNDkyMzdiNzg3Yzg4IiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"W.I.T.C.H.","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/WITCH/484525?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$30 advance and $32 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nZambian band, WITCH (We Intend To Cause Havoc), released two albums that found them, in a later line-up, replacing fuzz guitars with whirling synthesizers and trying their hand at soul, disco and boogie.

Though there was a lot to process already in those months, it was an opportune time to try and get your shit together, whatever that may mean for you. For Jakob Armstrong—in addition to many other things like the rest of us—part of it meant fine-tuning a collection of songs first recorded in late 2019. A prolonged process leading to five of the seven songs on Get Yourself a Friend retooled into their better-than-even final form. \nJakob Armstrong—youngest son of Green Day frontman Billie Joe—began playing guitar at seven years old and honed his craft privately until about sixteen, playing in bands in and around Oakland after meeting friends with like-minded tastes in music. Soon enough, with the memories of Ultraman action figures fighting in his mind, he and a group of friends he cultivated from those years playing around and pouring over records, formed Ultra Q (its name inspired by an Ultraman prequel series).\nFusing together the skyward lift of Interpol, the clever guitar interplay of the Strokes, the maudlin romanticism of the Cure, and the often impressionistic narrative gifts of Arctic Monkeys, Ultra Q’s growth since their 2019 EP We’re Starting to Get Along has been exponential. A traditional alternative rock sound was baked by the California heat, shards of broken glass gleaming in the sunlight, spanning the distance from Berkeley to Rodeo Drive. Over blaring guitars and thunderous drums, Armstrong’s voice is carried by a very familiar lilt. 2020’s In a Cave in a Video Game, self-recorded by Armstrong on a whim while quarantined, could easily be slotted between the blown-out, lo-fi tones of early Wavves and the works of intentionally harsh-sounding Columbus band Psychedelic Horseshit.\nOpening double-shot “Pupkin” and “It’s Permanent” soar to the heights of Ultra Q’s powers in much different ways; the former a black-clad romp through a rainy graveyard, the former pushing straight to the clouds with its soaring chorus. “Straight Jacket” veers pleasantly close to the jangle-pop of the Go-Betweens. “Bowman” features guitars like cats getting into a scratch-fight while an astoundingly metronomic drumbeat is played live rather than punched out on a beat pad. Closing the EP is its title track, an affecting end credits anthem full of nostalgia and a twinge of regret. \nAs a whole, Get Yourself a Friend marks the synthesis of a songwriter’s vision and his band’s ability, forged through an invisible existential threat and an ever-changing world, eager to show what they’ve found while we were all inside. — Martin Douglas"},{"date":"2022-06-27T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiODgwNWZmZGEtZjk3Yy00NjE4LTllYzktMWFkNjEyNWJkMmJjIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Los Bitchos","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Los-Bitchos/470296?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$20 advance and $22 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nIt’s been a busy lockdown for Los Bitchos, we’re beyond excited to say, they’ve finished recording their debut album with Franz Ferdinand frontman, Alex Kapranos, and of course, it sounds like the biggest party imaginable.\nWith an arsenal of new tracks and a crazy tour schedule, they’re chomping at the bit to get out and play live again.\nChampioned by the likes of Cheryl Waters, Khurangbin, King Gizzard, Marc Riley, She Shreds, Vogue, NME, DIY and SXSW.

At age twelve, she traded chores for guitar lessons; at sixteen, she took on after school jobs to pay for voice lessons, learning to drive so she could take herself to both.\nAs a first-generation Afghan-American child of working-class immigrant parents, finding a place in music has been nothing short of a challenge for Qudus. “Women are often discouraged from pursuing music in the Afghan \u0026 Muslim community, and those who follow that path receive a lot of heat,” she explains.\nQudus’ earliest creative pursuits began with her solo project Doe Eye, which found quick success with radio play, magazine features and blogosphere buzz after 2014’s T E L E V I S I O N—a lush collection of indie pop and spacey rock produced by John Vanderslice at his legendary San Francisco co-op-turned-studio Tiny Telephone.\nWorking with Vanderslice opened new artistic avenues for Qudus: “Seeing the lit up VU meters on the console and multiple tape machines running really inspired me. I realized the studio is an instrument and if you know how to use it, you can take advantage of that in really cool ways.” She began studying at Bay Area recording arts non-profit Women’s Audio Mission, eventually interning both there and at Tiny Telephone before becoming a staff engineer at both. Studio tricks picked up from clients like Wax Nine’s Sad13, Toro Y Moi, Sasami \u0026 Tune-Yards gave new inspiration for her own arrangements. And in between sessions, she was able to toy with electronic ambience and tape experimentations for Spacemoth—her latest solo project.\nSpacemoth’s debut album, No Past No Future, will be released July 22nd, 2022 on Wax Nine Carpark Records. Rich in intergalactic, avant-pop, No Past No Future serves as a reckoning point between nostalgia and nihilism; it explores the struggle to hang on to a moment as it warps in time. The bulk of performance and production comes from Qudus herself, who favors vintage synths like the Yamaha CS-50 and Korg Polysix alongside fluttering tape manipulations; creating cosmic, lush soundbeds, drawing comparisons to beloved projects like Broadcast and Stereolab. Every track flows with Qudus’ low timbered vocals, in harmony with the watery, glowing synthesizers that anchor the album. The result is an album radiating in astonishment at the emotional landscape humans contain within ourselves, and in wonder at the preciousness of our time on earth."},{"date":"2022-06-28T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiZTUwMGRhMjgtNzRlYy00MzZkLThiYTMtYWVkMDgwZDdjNjlmIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Dave Alvin and Jimmie Dale Gilmore with The Guilty Ones","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Dave-AlvinandJimmieDaleGilmorewithTheGuiltyOnes/477671?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$35 advance and $40 day of show\nPlease Note!

They have since emerged as an engine of the Bay Area’s revitalized psychedelic and festival scenes. Frontman Graham Patzner, who will crow like a medicine show preacher, and then coo you into the arms of his lovesick eternity, might be a spitfire protege of the underworld himself, though, through and through he will remind you that there is no rapture without artistry. On the surface this is splendid rock-and-roll, rooted in the classic, psych and glam rock tradition, but the pageantry and chaos of Whiskerman’s performances will leave you describing an experience more than a sound.\nWhiskerman is preparing to release their fourth studio album, Kingdom Illusion--a rock and roll vision quest that ushers the band’s elegiac psychedellia towards a louder, pushier, more colorful sound. Their past albums have been described as “ecstatic psychedelia, sturdily constructed pop-rock, pick-and-grin folk all together as a single picture.” (Flood Magazine)\nThe band is: Graham Patzner (vocals, guitar, violin and piano), Will Lawrence (bass), and Charles Lloyd (guitar and sitar), Dan Schwartz (drums), and Jeremy Lyon (guitar)."},{"date":"2022-07-05T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiMmJhNTA4ODgtZmNkMy00NWE5LThjZDgtZDUzOTg3YjFjNzU1IiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Adia Victoria","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Adia-Victoria/474714?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$20 advance and $22 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nAdia Victoria is a daughter of the South, a born and bred South Carolinian who now makes her home in Nashville, Tennessee. It is no surprise, then, that stories of the South find their way into her music, into the lyrics she pens and the chords she plays. It has been the case through her first two albums—2016’s Beyond the Bloodhounds and 2019’s Silences—and it remains so for third full-length effort, A Southern Gothic. This time, though, the stories don’t just belong to Victoria. \n“I feel like it is the first record where I was able to get enough distance from what I thought was myself in order to look out and tell stories that were not necessarily my own,” she explains. “Because my immediate conditions were so limited it opened my imagination to think of other people, other characters, other perceptions and experiences that are all rooted in the south, to this land that informs us, that we grow on and grow in.”\nSonically, A Southern Gothic is full of frequent juxtaposition. It is equal parts historical montage and modern prophesy, dark and light, love and loathing. Put simply, it is the musical embodiment of the relationship that so many people, especially Black women, have with the South. Indeed, even as Victoria’s lyrics feel weighted by a Southern heaviness that is so often smothering, the music is also buoyed by rhythm and melody that illuminate the best of what this region has to offer. \n“You are getting that chill music, that vibe,” she explains, “but I wanted you to also get that ethereal feel of the South. I wanted you to get the humidity of it, the heat, the ways we reach to the pits of hell and the heights of heaven. I wanted this record to encapsulate the extremes of the South.”\nThe extremes are there; so, too, are the sounds of the South. Victoria notes that, during the writing process, she listened to Alan Lomax’s old field recordings, to the ways Black folk made music from and with the land. The sounds became the heartbeat, or foundation, of her new music, upon which she and creative partner Mason Hickman later layered other parts. And in many ways, the story of working with Hickman to write and produce A Southern Gothic is as critical to the project as the stories Victoria tells across the album’s 14 tracks. \nRecording for A Southern Gothic began in Paris in 2019/early 2020, and it was while in France that Victoria discovered a sense of clarity about her home that she didn’t always have when she was writing from her home. The first song cut was “My Oh My,” a haunting, guitar-driven track that undergirds the story of a young woman struggling to hold tight to her sister’s presence after her death. The time and space away from the South was critical for helping Victoria to develop the overall themes for the album—and for giving her the early fuel that would help her continue to create through quarantine.\n“I would say that the philosophy behind this record is, ‘Necessity is the mother of invention,’” Victoria says. “It’s also, ‘When you don’t have excess, when that’s all stripped away, what you gon’ do with that?’ What art can you make from walking through your mother’s garden?”\nWithout excess or access—to musicians, producers, studio—Victoria and Hickman became a two-man band of sorts, connecting over Victoria’s collection of Southern tales as they tried to keep the pandemic from killing them. Hickman taught himself mandolin and banjo while Victoria cut drum and piano parts. And later, even when the world began to re-open, vaccines became available, and Victoria was able to get in the studio with executive producer T-Bone Burnett, the recordings that Victoria and Hickman had done on their own remained. \n“I wanted the album to be a time stamp of where I was in 2020,” Victoria says. “I wanted to pay homage and be honest to what I had to work with. I didn’t feel the need to go back and change it and pretty it up. It was honest and it was true.”\nThe result is a project that fits perfectly into Victoria’s catalogue and the rich legacy of Black Southern storytelling, even as it stands alone as a freshly innovative work. T Bone Burnett says, “Adia Victoria sings on an arc between Memphis Minnie and Sojourner Truth.”\nAdds Victoria: “With this project, I was so anchored in the past and the Black brilliance that came before me that it was kind of a road map. They said, ‘Sweetie, we’re gonna locate you, and we’re gonna allow you to move it forward.’"},{"date":"2022-07-06T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiZDA1ZDdlYmUtYmE2NS00ZjVmLTg4M2MtODFlODM3OTQ5NmFhIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Cloud Cult","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Cloud-Cult/465678?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$28 advance and $32 day of show\n\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nPlease note this is a partially seated show.

In its infancy, rock was a playful rebuttal against segregation and Puritanism. In the ‘60s, it became a vehicle for an elevated consciousness. In the years following the Summer of Love and the clampdown on Flower Power, that countercultural spirit adopted the aggravated and occasionally nihilistic edge of bands like The Stooges, Black Sabbath, MC5, and The New York Dolls. And then as the ‘80s approached, popular rock n’ roll turned into a relatively benign celebration of hedonism and decadence, but that contingent of dark mystics from the ‘70s who lifted the veil and used music as a means of rallying people to altered planes had left their mark. It was an undercurrent in rock that would never die, but would percolate in corners of the underground. Today we can see it manifest in LA’s Death Valley Girls.\nThe group feels less like a band and more like a travelling caravan. At their core, vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Bonnie Bloomgarden and guitarist Larry Schemel channel Death Valley Girls’ modern spin on Fun House’s sonic exorcisms, early ZZ Top’s desert-blasted riffage, and Sabbath’s occult menace. Their relentless touring schedule means that the remainder of the group is rounded out by whichever like-minded compatriots can get in the van. On their third album Darkness Rains, bassist Alana Amram, drummer Laura Harris, and a rotating cast of guests like Shannon Lay, The Kid (Laura Kelsey) and members of The Make Up, The Shivas, and Moaning help elevate the band from their rogue beginnings to a communal ritualistic musical force. On the surface level, Death Valley Girls churn out the hypercharged, in the red, scuzzy rock every generation yearns for, but there is a more subversive force percolating beneath the surface that imbues the band with an exhilarating cosmic energy.\nDeath Valley Girls’ sophomore album Glow In The Dark was based on the concept that many of us are trying to become more enlightened, and you can tell by the way they ‘glow in the dark.’ Darkness Rains goes a step further, attempting to shift the consciousness of those that have not yet considered how we are all connected and how that relates to the way we view life beyond death. Those that ‘glow’ can use the songs on Darkness Rains as new chants—or they can be used for pure entertainment. “Songs come from beyond and other worlds, you just have to tune into the right radio wave signal to dial them in. Our signal happens to be in a 1970 Dodge Charger Spaceship,” says Schemel.\nAlbum opener “More Dead” is a rousing wake up call, with a hypnotic pentatonic guitar riff and an intoxicating blown-out fuzz-wah solo underscoring Bloomgarden’s consciousness-rattling proclamation that you’re “more dead than alive.” The pace builds with “(One Less Thing) Before I Die”, a minute-and-a-half distillate of Detroit’s classic proto-punk sound. But at track three, Death Valley Girls hit their stride with “Disaster (Is What We’re After)”, a gritty, swaggering rager that takes the most boisterous moments off Exile On Main Street and beefs it up with Zeppelin’s devil’s-note blues. Darkness Rains retains its intoxicating convocations across ten tracks, climaxing on an astral plane with the hypnotic guitar drones and cult-like chants of “TV In Jail On Mars.”\n“Learn from the stars and beyond! Be happy and thankful we got to live together on Earth at the same time! And death is just a shift—stay alive and awake,” Bloomgarden and Schemel respond when asked for a final thought on Death Valley Girls. “Embrace the darkness and don’t fear the Reaper.” Suicide Squeeze Records is proud to further the cause by releasing Darkness Rains on October 5th, 2018 on LP/CD/CS/ and digital formats. The first vinyl pressing is limited to 1,500 copies. Both the cassette and vinyl include digital downloads."},{"date":"2022-07-16T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiZmE1ZGVjZmQtNzU4MC00ODgyLTkzYTctMzgzYWFmYTZlNzUxIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Martin Courtney","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Martin-Courtney/483169?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$20 advance and $24 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \n\nWhen Martin Courtney was a teenager, he knew how to get lost. In the late ‘90s and early 2000s, there’s Martin, 17 or 18, loaded into a car with friends, stoned and aimless. They’re navigating the suburban sprawl of New Jersey with no destination in mind.It’s a densely settled wooded area, Courtney explains. “There’s so many towns you can drive for 15 minutes and have no clue where you are,” he says, sitting in his home studio in Beacon, New York, where he wrote the songs that make up Magic Sign, the second solo album from the Real Estate songwriter.\n\nIt opens with “Corncob,” an ode to those bygone nights. “20 minutes from your house/There are places you don’t know/Problem is if you find them/You’ll have no place else to go,” he sings over a gentle psychedelic guitar wash. When Courtney was young, he and his friends would “get thoroughly confused and look for familiar green signs with arrows pointing to towns we’d heard of,” Courtney says. “We’d call them ‘magic signs.’”That’s the thing about magic: when you go looking for it, you start to see it everywhere. And you can hear it twinkingly throughout the 10 songs on Magic Sign.\nWritten throughout 2020 and 2021, the album came together late at night, while Courtney’s kids slept upstairs and his wife workedovernight shifts at the hospital, a role reversal from his former days out on tour while she stayed home with their family. “I used to sit and think of you/I’d write a song or two/And passing the fleeting hours,”he sings of those days on the tender “Living Rooms,” which documents the domestic scenes that accompanied his nights writing.\nJust like when he was a kid, Courtney didn’t set out to find a whole record, he just wandered and let the signs guide him. Eventually, those imaginary directional arrows took him from his home base to Silent Partner in Philadelphia, PA, where he laid down basic tracks with Matt Barrick of The Walkmen, then back home to expand and develop the tunes, and then to Los Angeles, where he decamped to Mant Sounds to record with Rob Schnapf (Elliott Smith/Kurt Vile) before engaging in bicoastal late night mixing sessions with the producer.\nNostalgia is naturally woven into Courtney’s sensibility. “I was singing about the good old days even on the first Real Estate album,” he laughs, noting that the “old days” were only two or three years ago at that point. Courtney doesn’t spend the entire record looking back—many of these are his most present tense to date—but a youthful exuberance does propel it forward. Courtney notes that he imagined the songs emerging in a post-pandemic world, providing a soundtrack for better days of relief and optimism.\nThe result is a set of songs that balance joyful abandon with late night wistfulness. “Sailboat” hums with Yo La Tengo buzziness; “Merlin” rolls with a gentle strut; the aforementioned “Corncob” ambles with a golden hued pop elegance. “It was a lot of first thought, best thought,” he says, noting the album’s improvised guitar solos, which sounds celebratory and striking. “I wanted to make music I wanted to hear, in a world that wasn't so dark and shitty,” he explains.\nThat hopefulness blooms on the love song “Exit Music,” which closes the record. “Though we’re not as young as we once were/we both know we’ve still got time for sure,”he sings over chiming Feelies electric and acoustic guitars. And that’s the nature of “signs,” they’re outward symbols encountered while the journey is currently in progress. They dot the landscape of Martin Courtney’s songs, inviting you to head off in a direction of your choosing and see what you find"},{"date":"2022-07-18T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiZGY1NjM0MDYtNGM2Ni00YmI5LTgwYTAtZjIzZjYxNjZjMjFhIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"The Zombies","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/The-Zombies/465681?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$60 advance and $65 day of show\n$180 VIP \nVIP option includes:\n1 General Admission ticketZombies vintage logo tote bagUnion Jack Beach TowelVIP Laminate\n\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nIconic British psychedelic pop legends The Zombies are back to celebrate their long-awaited Induction into The Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame, with a new album in the works and their 2022 “Life Is A Merry-Go-Round” Tour. \nAfter receiving their 4th nomination in 5 years, the support for The Zombies’ induction among the public and their peers was undeniable - the band placed 4th in the public online poll with over 330,000 votes, while even fellow nominee John Prine called for their induction before his own in a Billboard interview. On March 29, 2019 at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, The Zombies joined Stevie Nicks, Radiohead, The Cure, Def Leppard, Janet Jackson, and Roxy Music as the 2019 Class of The Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame. Fittingly, the Induction Ceremony took place exactly 50 years to-the-day after The Zombies’ classic “Time of the Season” first hit #1 on the charts in America.\nNever content to only look back, The Zombies spent the Pandemic touring-hiatus in the studio recording the follow-up to their 2015 Billboard-charting album, Still Got That Hunger. The title for their 2022 tour - “Life Is A Merry-Go-Round” - is a lyric from one of the new songs, but is also a fitting description of the dizzying effect the past 2 years have had on the world.

On March 29, 2019 at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, The Zombies joined Stevie Nicks, Radiohead, The Cure, Def Leppard, Janet Jackson, and Roxy Music as the 2019 Class of The Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame. Fittingly, the Induction Ceremony took place exactly 50 years to-the-day after The Zombies’ classic “Time of the Season” first hit #1 on the charts in America.\nNever content to only look back, The Zombies spent the Pandemic touring-hiatus in the studio recording the follow-up to their 2015 Billboard-charting album, Still Got That Hunger. The title for their 2022 tour - “Life Is A Merry-Go-Round” - is a lyric from one of the new songs, but is also a fitting description of the dizzying effect the past 2 years have had on the world.

An upstart songwriter and producer, he, of course, loved its creative wellspring—the ideas, the instrumentalists, the energy. But he’d grown up in the woods of upstate New York and, later, along the coast on the rather empty eastern end of North Carolina. The city was expensive, anxious, and unsettling, however inspiring it could be.\nSo in the Summer of 2017, he and his band decamped to a rented house upstate to cut his second album, the magnetic You, Forever. He then realized he could no longer resist the urge; two years ago, Sam and his partner, Hannah Cohen, split from the city, building their refuge in the quiet of a Catskills town. That reflective, relaxing environment inexorably shaped Time to Melt, his third LP and debut for Fat Possum. A glowing set of soulfully psychedelic pop gems, Time to Melt is a testimonial to the life and wisdom to be found when you give yourself the mercy of space.\nDuring the last decade, Sam has become a preeminent collaborator, producing and engineering records for the likes of Big Thief, Cass McCombs, and Widowspeak as Sam Owens, his given name. In their new home, he and Hannah hosted bands like house guests as he helmed their sessions. The coronavirus, though, clamped down on those interactions, largely sealing the couple from their longtime scene.\nSo Sam tried something new: He sorted through more than 60 instrumental demos he’d recorded in the last two years and began shaping the most enticing of them into songs with help from Hannah and a cadre of long-distance friends—Spencer Tweedy, Chris Bear, Jon Natchez, even strangers who sent him voice memos via Instagram. He took the unexpected time at home to dig deeper into his world of sounds and ideas than ever before, calmly considering our moment of prevailing chaos through a lens of newfound distance.\nBut the last few years have been purely happy for mostly no one, Sam included. Time to Melt reckons with the weight of our time, even when it sounds largely weightless. Inspired by John Coltrane’s mixture of grace and gravitas and Marvin Gaye’s uncanny ability to turn social issues into personal anthems, Sam strove to give these otherwise-beguiling instrumentals the thoughtfulness and depth these days demand.\nWith its rubbery bassline and sweeping strings, “Freezee Pops” unfurls like a Summer breeze. It reads, though, like poetic testimony on police brutality, an innocent kid’s life plundered for prison-system profits. And “Knock Knock” taps Sam’s memories of race-and-class violence in the small-town South and his subsequent reckoning with our crumbling American façade, where “we tell ourselves almost anything but the truth.” The song is ultimately a tribute to the perseverance of the vulnerable, who find community and joy in spite of the way centuries of miscreants try to deny it.\nThere are also songs of utter celebration on Time to Melt, paeans to whatever joy it is we find in life or love. Buttressed by bold baritone sax, lifted by exuberant trumpet, and washed in fluorescent guitars, “Easy to Love” is an exultant ode to finding a new paradise outside of the city, an idyllic setting where you can plant love and literally watch it bloom. “Lonely Days” blows in with a muted brooding, but it’s a feint for Sam’s sweet hymn to a blissful partnership of shared solitude, a true blessing for a year when so many have been alone. “Lonely days are gone,” he repeats, his rhythm shifting just enough in the middle of the sentence to tease dejection and surprise with delight. Sam is so content in the Catskills that the lovely but warped “Sunshine” finds him imagining how heartache must feel, as though it were only ever a hypothetical muse. He sublimates a sense of seasick sadness into a compulsively funky oddity.\nAt home now near the Ashokan Reservoir with their new rescue dog, Jan, Sam and Hannah mostly listen to music while they cook dinner. That’s the kind of record Sam wanted to make—an album of sounds so pleasant and compelling that you put it on and follow the slipstream. He succeeded; Time to Melt is a waking dream, its intoxicating rhythms and timbral webs as settling, even seductive as an evening glass of wine. But making dinner, or whatever your ritual at day’s end may be, isn’t some idle exercise. It’s a place to unpack the pain and wonder, the suffering and promise of the moment, to reflect on where you have been and what might come next. In 40 striking minutes, or the time it may take you to make that meal, Time to Melt sorts through a year of a life spent in rage and hope, lockdown and love.\nMaia Friedman: “Pour me over, show me how to begin,” intones Maia Friedman on the first track of her lush, immaculate debut Under The New Light. Following a breadth of experience as a collaborator and multi-instrumentalist, Friedman’s densely-textured pop is wise and evokes what she wants it to: the sensuality of touch, feeling and image, a sonic form of empathy.\nAs an ode to the shifting landscape of our own lives, Friedman began Under the New Light four years ago, while teaching music and performing in multiple New York bands. “Collaborating gives me the juice,” she says, laughing. In 2018 Friedman was asked to join Dirty Projectors and a heavy schedule of touring followed. She sang and co-wrote the lyrics for the first of their 5 EPs, released last year, most notably for the soothing earworm “Overlord.” Meanwhile, Friedman also formed Coco, which began as a collaborative recording project with Oliver Hill (Dustrider, Pavo Pavo) and Dan Molad (Lucius, Chimney) and they released music anonymously until the announce of their 2021 self-titled debut.\nFriedman’s voice lends a unique quality of warm comfort that permeates all her collaborations, but Under the New Light presents her full intention. Her role is that of the wounded healer, one who has gained wisdom through darkness and grief. In her empathetic role, rather than share the details of any struggling, Friedman instead sought to build a cloud of safety for those who might have pain of their own. It’s an antidote to suffering rather than its depiction. The closest she comes to stark personal detail is on standout “Sunny Room”: “To be in a place that knows your mold / The tighter your hand the less you hold / You’re looking for a way to ease your mind / So you won’t make a mess of your good time.”\nGrowing up in the Sierra National Forest region of central California, Friedman lived with her mother, their two dogs and four cats, playing in the wilderness until evening when her mom blew a whistle for her return. The family moved to the southern California coast when she was ten where her father, a film editor, director and teacher, cultivated the home’s expansive music collection, gifting Maia a jazz album every birthday. Her mother, a Jungian Psychoanalyst, led a dream group and filled their home with books on mythology, symbolism and dream interpretation.\nIt’s this translation of the image into sonic reality that Friedman shoots for and achieves wholly throughout Under the New Light. On “Elevate Us,” a sparse, succinct ballad, Friedman lifts a simple moment of observation into the weight of the world: “listen to the woman on the screen, promising everything / I am left more or less the same, with or without it / Oh how they elevate us, not that it’s for real / But ah, the elevation I feel / like a flock above the wires, carried by the current / In with the breeze, out with the front / We watch the rising flood.”\nAs with her other projects, Friedman collaborated closely on Under the New Light as a trio with Tom Deis (Pineapple Room Studio) and Peter Lalish, with Dan Molad in a production role. They worked on the album sporadically across the country, in Omaha, New York, and Los Angeles. Friedman had melodies but left it open, with the trio co-writing the swirling harmonies together. The arrangements are less sparse than they feel and even when Friedman’s voice is accompanied by a single guitar, there are swirls of ambience and synthesized sound design building around her.\nThe album plays like a fulfilled journey, and though Friedman is still somewhere in the middle of her own, on Under the New Light her vision is fully formed. On the bright closer “A Sleep in the Garden,” she nods, for better or worse, toward the future: “I won’t look away / when you show me more.”"},{"date":"2022-07-22T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiMDQ5ZWJiM2UtZmVkMy00ZmM4LThjNjUtOWU5ZDM3MzM0N2RkIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"New Hope Club","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/New-HopeClub/482688?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$18 advance and $20 day of show\n$59 VIP PASS\nA TICKET TO THE SHOW IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS VIP PACKAGE - YOU MUST PURCHASE IT SEPARATELY.\nIt is not possible to attend the VIP without also attending the show.\nPackage includes:\nLaminate\nEarly entry\nSoundcheck + extra songs\nQ \u0026 A\nTo gain access to the VIP event please take a copy of your VIP confirmation e-mail, ticket to the event plus ID, to the venue on the night of the show.\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here.

The 14-year-old Boston Terrier has been there for the whole ride of Mapache, Clay Finch and Sam Blasucci’s band, which has grown from being the casual project of two longtime buds to one of the most formidable cosmic-folk acts around. “Roscoe’s been through a lot of shit,” says Blasucci, the dog’s formal owner. “He’s been all around the country, come on tour a little bit.” With some bemused pride, Finch points out that, for a few years, he and Blasucci bunked together in a room in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles that was just big enough to fit two twin beds. “It was the two of us and the dog,” he laughs.\nNaturally, Roscoe has found himself the subject of a good handful of Mapache songs in the past—and on Roscoe’s Dream, the band’s third LP of originals, he takes center stage. (That’s him in quilt form on the album cover.) “I Love My Dog” opens up the album with a blissed-out stack of acoustic guitars and a lyrical explanation of one of Roscoe’s many talents: “I love my dog Keepin’ the policeman out.”\nJust as much an easygoing trip with Gram Parsons into the desert as a mad dash with the Grateful Dead away from the law, Roscoe’s Dream is the purest distillation yet of the distinct Mapache sound, which has been brewing for many years now. Finch and Blasucci first met as students at La Cañada High School, just north of Los Angeles: “There wasn’t much supervision or anything,” remembers Blasucci. “It was really nice. And we got to just play guitars together.”\nThe two stayed friends through their college years—Finch went to Chico State and Blasucci spent two years as a missionary in Mexico—and eventually they ended up back in L.A., spending their days playing guitar together once again, just like old times. Working with producer/engineer Dan Horne (Cass McCombs, Allah-Lahs), they recorded two albums of originals (2017’s Mapache and 2020’s From Liberty Street) as well an album of covers, 2021’s 3. Often trading solos, and occasionally switching from English to Spanish, Finch and Blasucci are now a well-oiled machine.\nSo when it came time to record Roscoe’s Dream, they didn’t mess with the formula. The band booked some time at Horne’s Lone Palm Studio and called in a handful of friends to play additional parts, including Farmer Dave Scher of Beachwood Sparks on melodica and lap steel on a couple tracks. The family affair has always been how the band likes to work, but this time they approached it on a grander scale than before, recording live as a full group in some cases, as opposed to working over Finch and Blasucci’s initial guitar/vocal parts. “It was a bit more of a band experience,” explains Finch.\nThe finished product is an ode to the past as well as a bridge forward. Covers of songs like Bo Diddley’s “Diana” and Gabby Pahinui’s “Kaua‘i Beauty” act as nods to heroes of theirs while originals like “Man and Woman” and “Pearl to the Swine” take the template of golden-age rock and lovingly deconstruct it in a modernist lens. “(They Don’t Know) At the Beach” was inspired by the idea of what trailblazing oldies DJ Art Laboe might like—but the gentle ripper of a song would fit right in at a backyard party in 2022.\nHard to imagine after years of being roommates, Finch and Blasucci are also bridging forward in new ways themselves. After the album was in the can, Finch decided to get a little closer to the water by moving to Malibu, and Blasucci moved about an hour north to Ojai with his girlfriend (and Roscoe, of course). But they’re not worried about the new distance slowing them down: “I think if anything it will be bringing more things to the table,” Blasucci considers. “We’re just expanding out in different directions.”"},{"date":"2022-07-27T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiM2VkYmJmMGQtMmUzZC00Y2I1LTllZTgtNTU2N2UwMjRhYTM3IiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Man Man","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Man-Man/474861?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$20 advance and $25 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \n\nMan Man\nHonus Honus (aka Ryan Kattner) has devoted his career to exploring the uncertainty between life’s extremes: beauty and ugliness, order and chaos.

Pollard, Ian McLagan, Steve Earle, Drew Carey, and Nick Lowe, among many others. NRBQ songs have inspired cover versions by Bonnie Raitt, Los Lobos, Darlene Love, Dave Edmunds, She \u0026 Him, Widespread Panic, Yo La Tengo, and more.\nThe group served as the unofficial \"house band\" for The Simpsons for Seasons 10-12. They appeared as zombies in George Romero’s movie Day of the Dead. They have appeared at the Berlin Jazz Festival, the Grand Ole Opry, and Wilco’s Solid Sound Festival. In their 50+ year career, NRBQ has released almost as many albums, including a series of critically acclaimed titles in the past decade, among them Keep This Love Goin’ (2011), Brass Tacks (2014), and the 5-disc, 50-year retrospective, High Noon (2016). Of the brand-new studio album Dragnet, released at the end of 2021, Bill Bentley in Americana Highways says, “They play with such startling and powerful simplicity, a style that must be earned and not learned,” while Uncut says, “[it’s] as though the history of 20th-century popular and unpopular music has gone through thorough, playful distillation.”"},{"date":"2022-08-04T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiYjZkMWUxNWItNWNkYS00NjE3LTk3NmUtODkyMmQxODZiZDFiIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Foxing","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Foxing/476248?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$18 advance and $20 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nFoxing has garnered a reputation as a band that goes big with their albums. With each release, the St. Louis-based group has appeared downright determined to top the expansiveness of their previous works. But with three sprawling and well-received records now under their belt, the band has seemingly left themselves little ground to uncover. So, on their new album, Draw Down the Moon, they set their sights on the largest subject possible: The universe.\n“It’s about the idea of your cosmic significance,” explains frontman Conor Murphy. “The way you feel like a tiny speck in the grand scheme of the universe, that’s a feeling everybody has. You can get lost thinking about how small you are. But [Draw Down the Moon] subverts that a bit to explore how your connection to people and places and ideas is what binds you to the universe and reality.”\nTo tackle this literally limitless topic on Draw Down the Moon, a joint release between Hopeless Records and the band’s own Grand Paradise, Murphy took a song-by-song approach. With each of the album’s ten lush tracks, he expanded upon a different worldly theme, as viewed through the greater lens of the cosmic fabric to which we’re all bound. Age, financial ruin, sexuality, commitment, success, homes, luck, vulnerability, trust, and death are all mined for insights that together paint a galactic picture. “With each of them, the intention is to recognize that you are one small speck of the universe, but also that you’re surrounded by these other small specks, and your connectivity to them is what gives you purpose and meaning.”\nOn “737,” the album’s ethereal opener, Murphy delves deep into the universal experience of aging, or “your number on the linear timeline of your finite life,” as he puts it. It’s a fitting topic for a band that fans have watched grow and evolve drastically over the last decade. While Foxing often got labeled as a post-everything band with their 2013 debut, The Albatross, they’ve since matured into an eclectic identity that critics had a hard time pinning down on their most recent work, 2018’s widely acclaimed Nearer My God. “Generally, I think everyone grows with us,” Murphy says. “We have such a dedicated fanbase that they’re aging with us and following us as our taste changes. I was 18 when we were writing The Albatross, straight out of high school. My priorities were very different than they are ten years later, as I’m 27 going on 28. Out of high school, you feel it’s important to write about relationships and unrequited love and studying abroad. Then, as you grow, your perspective changes. Now, I’m at the point where I’m consistently having existential crises. But I think people have scaled with us.”\n\n“It feels like a natural evolution of what we initially set out to do,” adds guitarist Eric Hudson. “We always tried to be very ambitious, musically, but the music is always the backdrop for what’s being said lyrically.”\nAfter the crescendoing “737,” Murphy explores themes of debt on the danceable “Go Down Together” and success on the entrancing “Where the Lightning Strikes Twice.” On the album’s titular track, he waxes about the significance of romantic commitment, even in the face of the vast universe, with lines like “I will always be your home I wanna show you I can keep it all together.” Draw Down the Moon ultimately culminates with an assist from avant-garde artist WHY? on the cathartic closer, “Speak with the Dead,” on which the band tackles the big one: death.\nTo help them pin down this overly ambitious project, Foxing brought in some additional help. After working for more than a year on their tracks at their studio in St. Louis, with Hudson at the helm as producer, the band took them to Georgia, where they holed up for a couple weeks with members of Manchester Orchestra. Combining the efforts of two bands who are each known for composing overly grandiose works might have been a recipe for disaster, but the collaborative process widened the scope of an already bold project. “It sounds chaotic but it was actually really good,” Murphy says. “They completely changed some of the songs and it was not what we were planning to do. It reworked a lot of the structures, and monumentally changed my feelings on those songs.”\nDraw Down the Moon wields an other worldly power that at times feels spiritual, and its creation took as much inspiration from religion as it did from magic and role-playing games like Dungeons \u0026 Dragons. The album title itself is derived from Margot Adler’s ritual book, Drawing Down the Moon. “I’ve been in a place in my life for a long time of deep resentment for religion, specifically Catholicism,” Murphy says, “but I felt like on this one we explored that idea of magic and ritual on a deeper level than just fiction. I value that so much now.”\nWhile Draw Down the Moon’s celestial nature often leads it to sound like a record as large as the galaxy itself, it is, at its heart, about all of us on the ground level—the tiny specks floating around together. “There are no life lessons in the record,” says Murphy. “It’s just saying: It’s OK to feel like this. We are all insignificant, but everyone around us is so insignificant, and together, we actually make up all of reality in the universe.”\n\nFoxing is Conor Murphy, Eric Hudson \u0026 Jon Hellwig"},{"date":"2022-08-06T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiNGVhMTcyMGQtNGEzNy00OTk5LTk1MTMtMjk0ZjUyMmUzZGRhIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Papercuts, The Umbrellas, Chime School","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Papercuts-TheUmbrellasChimeSchool/482256?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$20 advance and $25 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nSlumberland Records announces its first ever label package tour with five west coast shows featuring Papercuts, The Umbrellas, Chime School and The Reds, Pinks \u0026 Purples.

Born \u0026 raised in Syðrugøta (population: 453), a tiny community on one of the northerly Faroe Is-lands, the singer-songwriter grew up surrounded by a harsh, windswept landscape and the North Atlantic, a rugged backdrop that has, unsurprisingly, deeply influenced her mu-sic. Songs such as ‘Tides’, ‘Fog Banks’, ‘Waves And The Wind’ tied themes like love and growing old to the primitive environment of her youth; she wrote ‘Into The Mist’ (from her widely praised 2017 UK debut, ‘Slør’) about getting lost on a local mountain, Støðlafjall.\nSegl - Eivør’s ninth studio album, since releasing her debut at just 17 - builds on these motifs, exploring the journeys we undertake as humans, both metaphorically and physically. The title – meaning ‘sail’ in Faroese – alludes to our desire for growth and direction, and the role that fate plays in both. “You have to hoist your own sail,” says Eivør, “but you cannot control the wind.” Thus Segl explores the navigation between the soft and rough edges of life, and the balance that must be struck between strength and vulnerability, dark and light. “How will you find calm in the chaos?” \nHer search for an answer began three years ago, just after the release of the English-language version of Slør (a companion version to the original, sung entirely in Faroese, which came out in 2015). The release triggered widespread critics’ approval and her debut appearance on Later……With Jools Holland, which blended traditional Faroese a cappella elements with throat singing and shamanic hand drumming. With numerous side projects and collaborations also competing for her time, Segl represents “my longest process of writing and creating an album”, a fact that, Eivør says, “definitely” shaped the music. But then, so has her illustrious career to date, and a life spent honing her singular musical talents."},{"date":"2022-08-12T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiNjA3MzNjNGEtNDMxNC00ZmI0LTk0MzItMDczMjY0NTRhMTMzIiwiZWRpdHMiOnsicmVzaXplIjp7IndpZHRoIjozNjUsImhlaWdodCI6MzY1fX19","title":"Greg Loiacono","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Greg-Loiacono/479663?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$20 advance and $25 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here.\nFrom his first gigs with the legendary The Mother Hips all the way up to his most recent solo album Mystic Traces, Greg Loiacono has always been driven by one unwavering desire: to connect.

Before the band had even graduated from school, they were signed to Rick Rubin’s American Recordings on the strength of their debut album, Back To The Grotto. Over the ensuing two-and-a-half decades, they would go on to release nine more studio albums as they cemented their status as architects of a new breed of California rock and roll, one equally informed by the breezy harmonies of the Beach Boys, the funky roots of The Band, and the psychedelic Americana of Buffalo Springfield.\n\nGreg’s latest release Mystic Traces was recorded in Ojai, California by Scott Hirsch (Hiss Golden Messenger) and features guest appearances by Mikael Jogenesen (Wilco), Kyle Field (Little Wings), Neal Casal, Jesse Seibenberg, Jamie Drake and many more."},{"date":"2022-08-13T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiMDQ1YjA0YjYtMzQwYS00ZmE0LThmYjAtYjVlNWVlYjA0Nzg0IiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Petty Theft","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Petty-Theft/477037?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$20 advance and $22 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nSince 2003, San Francisco-based Petty Theft has been touring the western United States performing Tom Petty’s songs true to the originals and in the spirit of the Heartbreaker’s live shows.\n\n\"Best of the North Bay 2022, 2021 : Best Cover Band\" - North Bay Bohemian\n\"Best of Marin 2020, 2019, 2018 : Best Cover Band\" – Pacific Sun\n\"Best of Marin 2015: Best Local Band\" – Pacific Sun\n\"Best Band San Francisco North Bay\" – 2013, 2012, 2011 – The Bohemian\n\n------------------\nPETTY THEFT IS:\nADAM \"BAGEL\" BERKOWITZ\nDAN DURKIN\nDJANGO BAYLESS\nMICHAEL PAPENBURG\nMONROE GRISMAN\nSTEVEN SEYDLER\nwww.pettytheftrocks.com"},{"date":"2022-08-21T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiOGU4MDBkNjAtOGZlOS00YjQ0LWFiY2MtZTdkNjdlY2QwNGMzIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"The Bellwether Syndicate, Then Comes Silence","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/The-BellwetherSyndicateThenComesSilence/485814?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$22 advance and $25 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here.\n\nTHE BELLWETHER SYNDICATE \nFormed in 2012, THE BELLWETHER SYNDICATE is fronted by veteran artist William Faith (vocals/guitars), and Sarah Rose Faith (vocals/guitars). While the studio recordings are made by William and Sarah alone, the live lineup includes Paul Sin (bass) and Philly Peroxide (keyboards/percussion) and Stevyn Grey (drums). The band have always sought to color outside of prescribed genre lines, endeavoring to push past the boundaries of style into something substantial and vital.\nReleased in 2013, The Night Watch EP was supported by a string of dates both domestic and abroad, culminating in the band delivering a celebrated performance at Germany’s storied Wave-Gotik-Treffen festival in 2014.\nReleased in 2018 (as a single from the forthcoming album), Republik is an alluring piece of glam noir, fusing a raw, swing groove with William’s crooned vocal, itself a lyrical lamentation of the erosion of communication between people in this troubled era, while Sarah’s liquid guitars gently sweeten the delivery before the song gives way to an instantly-memorable, anthemic chorus, bursting with glam rock guitar and tribal drums, as the timely lyric compels us to “wake up” and turn back from the precipice while there’s still time…\nTHEN COMES SILENCE\nThen Comes Silence are the Swedish captains of postpunk. The quartet from Stockholm is a fresh breeze of gothic renaissance, kicking darkness around with hammering rhythms and melodies that make hearts melt and blood freeze. The fascination for doom and darkness pervade and influence every tune and word.\nThe music of Then Comes Silence takes the listener on a journey from swinging postpunk to the shadows of goth-gaze and into scraps of coal hearted psych. The sharp soundscape is intense, massive and pounding. The lyrics flirt with death and sorrow. It’s goth, psychedelica, rock and post-punk in a symbiosis. Since the band’s very first show, as the opening act for A Place to Bury Strangers in 2012.\nThe sonic collaboration of two guitars creates an imaginative dimensional sonic picture, propelled either side of the drum and bass lead, like a dark and winged creature. Sinister and threatening vocals set up a presence that is both exciting and foreboding. Adrenaline guaranteed! Their music attracts wide attention and is praised for its apocalyptic sound and dystopian message.\nIn 2018 the band opened for Fields Of The Nephilim and Chameleons Vox in Germany and are more frequently a part of the line-up on the festivals in Europe. The same year, Seth Kapadia and Jens Karnstedt left the band and the former session musicians and touring substitutes Mattias Ruejas Jonson (ex A PROJECTION) and Spanish born Hugo Zombie (ex Los Carniceros Del Norte) became the new members in the band."},{"date":"2022-08-26T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiYWFiZTUwNjQtMTQ2My00MGFlLTk4MDMtMGJhNGYxYTA3ZmNjIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"River Whyless","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/River-Whyless/477023?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$20 advance and $24 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nIn August 2019, the four members of River Whyless - Halli Anderson, Ryan O’Keefe, Daniel Shearin and Alex McWalters  - secluded themselves for thirty days deep in the hills outside Asheville, NC. Their intention was to make a record, the band’s fourth full-length effort, and first without a producer since their 2012 debut A Stone, A Leaf, An Unfound Door. Back then, that constraint was a matter of necessity. This time, it was deliberate.\nUsing mostly gear from Shearin’s recording studio, the band converted McWalter’s house into a multi-level homemade recording space. The basement became the control room and drum world. The main level, with its high ceilings and pine floors, was well-equipped for acoustic guitars and violin. They didn’t know yet where the vocals would be tracked. In truth, they didn’t know much except that they had the gear they needed, some time, and a collection of very rough-hewn demos they hoped could be shaped into something honest and cohesive.  \nAccustomed to arriving at the studio well-rehearsed, for Monoflora, Shearin, Anderson, O’Keefe and McWalters came intentionally unprepared. They wanted to capture ideas at their source, in the very moment of their creation. They would start the tape and let it roll until they could let their conscious minds forget they were recording. Then they could simply create. Arrangements were fleshed out and captured on the spot. The foundation of songs were often recorded with the singers in a room together with a guitar, writing harmonies and lyrics as they went. Many of the vocals were finished within the first few takes, or even with the scratch take. Early experimental drum ideas were slowed down and pitched-shifted to blend with a changing vision of a song.\nOf course, opting for this freedom of experimentation in lieu of a well-rehearsed outfit did come with a cost. “I think we were all unpleasantly surprised by how short a month suddenly felt as soon as we started grappling with the challenge we’d created for ourselves,” O’Keefe says. There were many, long days and nights, especially for Shearin, who, by virtue of his experience in the world of recording, was wearing at least two hats at all times: that of artist and engineer. O’Keefe, Monoflora’s defacto assistant engineer, could relate. “It’s an intensely immersive and romantic experience to be wearing all the hats at once,” he says. “It’s empowering, exciting. But it’s also exhausting. We knew this, and yet…we were determined to put our years of experience to the test.”\nOn Monoflora the band has, in some ways, returned to its more acoustic origins, this album shed of the hard-driving, electrified and/or synthesized outwardness that propelled 2018’s Kindness, A Rebel. But while Monoflora certainly features more acoustic guitar and violin than both Kindnessand 2016’s We All The Light, it would be inaccurate (or oversimple) to say that it harkens back to River Whyless’ earlier, “folksier” efforts, like 2012’s Stone and/or its eponymous 2015 EP. The arrangements on Monoflora are, in many cases, more intricate and dynamic than any of the band’s previous work, the instrumentation more eclectic and expansive, the members’ roles as individual musicians more fluid and diverse. In the end, River Whyless is proud of what they’ve made, pleased by the ways this album reflects growth, and for the ways that it seems like a culmination of all previous works.\nRiver Whyless has graced the stages of beloved festivals such as Newport Folk Festival, Bonnaroo, and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass.  They have also received critical acclaim from NPR Music, American Songwriter, and Stereogum, among many others.
