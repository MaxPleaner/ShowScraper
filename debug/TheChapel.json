The set includes exhilarating live renditions of the IDM forward album alongside IAMX favorites reworked for the modular and performed solo. Corner’s mesmerizing vocals will carry the performance. Sometimes raw, pristine and clear, sometimes cleverly manipulated through experimental loop machines and fx, modified beyond recognition to merge with the beats and soundscape of the modular synthesizer. An immersive light show designed by IAMX accompanies the performance, which will be stopping in a limited number of venues and outdoor spaces \u0026 at selected festivals through North America and Europe. \nCHRIS CORNER’s process of becoming IAMX has been theatrical, transcendent and communal. Androgynous and visceral, he has metamorphosed from small-town kid to international pop star with iconic trip-hop group SNEAKER PIMPS, to a creator of raw art that disrupts gender and genre. Fueling electronic experimentation with punk energy and confessional lyricism, Corner’s dark sound, performances, videos, fashion and persona are larger than life, iconoclastic and shockingly intimate. \nAfter releasing Kiss + Swallow in 2004 and moving from his native UK to Berlin, Germany in 2005, IAMX released six additional albums over the following eight years. In 2013 Corner suffered from Chronic Insomnia and Depression, prompting a move to Los Angeles and yielding the album Metanoia in 2015. An intensely cathartic body of work, Metanoia represented a comeback and a turning point in Corner’s life. The album allowed him to explore themes of mental health that eventually led to partnerships with organizations like the You Rock Foundation, to start his own mental health podcast called Headnoise and to release Headstreams (out Spring 2022), an art and poetry book on the subject.\nSince 2015 IAMX has released several more albums ranging from experimental electronica to his 2020 acoustic album Echo Echo, which Corner co-produced with GRAMMY Award winning super-producer DAVID BOTTRILL. In 2021 the prolific artist delivered a long-awaited new album with Sneaker Pimps and a modular electronic album as IAMX.\nBoth have been released via his new record label UNFALL, which he founded alongside longtime IAMX live bassist and collaborator JANINE GEZANG with the goal of supporting music with a real message and keeping revenue streams transparent and accessible for any artist UNFALL supports and releases.\nCorner is a heavily licensed artist, with 16 IAMX tracks on ABC’s series ‘How To Get Away with Murder’ alone, multiple songs on ‘CSI: Crime Scene Investigation’, amongst many other top shows globally and numerous soundtrack and commercial contributions as Sneaker Pimps.\nAs a video artist, Corner crafts stunning live visuals and music videos for IAMX and other acts such as his close friend GARY NUMAN. Just as the X in mathematics signifies the variable and unpredictable, Corners’ identity and artistry evolve through experiment and fierce independence. As a result, his work continues to deepen with his ever-expanding catalogue of projects."},{"date":"2022-05-06T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiN2RiYzVkNTQtMzdmOC00ZGNlLWIwZDAtNGU2YTg1MWFjZThiIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"The Mother Hips (rescheduled from 4/23)","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/The-MotherHipsrescheduledfrom423/472358?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$28 advance and $30 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here.\nPLEASE NOTE: THIS SHOW HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED FROM SATURDAY, APRIL 23.

Few things in this world can conjure up such sensations quite like the sight of a glowing lantern in a darkened window.\n“The glowing lantern is a universal symbol for sanctuary,” says Mother Hips co-founder Tim Bluhm. “That’s what we wanted this album to be: a warm safe place to get in out of the dark cold night.”\nWritten and recorded through the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic, Glowing Lantern is indeed a work of great comfort, even as it grapples with the profound anxiety of these troubling and uncertain times. The songs here are weighty, abstract ruminations wrapped in unflagging optimism, bittersweet streams of consciousness delivered with a jaunty confidence in better days to come. Bluhm and fellow co-founder Greg Loiacono produced the album themselves, and the juxtaposition of darkness and light in their stark lyrics and buoyant arrangements reflect a tension familiar to anyone who’s ever struggled to find their footing or make sense of the inexplicable. At the heart of it all, though, is a distinct sense of camaraderie, a feeling of closeness and brotherhood that the band has ironically only come to rediscover as a result of the past year of isolation and lockdowns. Glowing Lantern is as collaborative a record as The Mother Hips have ever made, and it’s impossible not to feel the joy, gratitude, and friendship radiating out of it like a beacon in the night."},{"date":"2022-05-07T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiNmRjOGMyZGQtZjg0Mi00YzU5LTkzNWMtYjUwYWYwMGJhYjZmIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Anaïs Mitchell","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Anas-Mitchell/465695?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$30 advance and $35 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \n\nANAÏS MITCHELL is a Vermont and Brooklyn-based singer- songwriter, and the Tony and Grammy award-winning creator of the Broadway musical Hadestown for which she wrote the book, music and lyrics.

After nearly 500 live appearances in almost a dozen countries, and with a slew of albums and singles to their name, Jenny Don’t And The Spurs are just getting warmed up.\n\nThe Spurs were founded one cold, winter’s evening by Jenny and Kelly. Jenny had been fronting her own band, DON’T, for some time, as well as playing the occasional solo acoustic set here and there. Kelly, who had been in a slew of Portland punk bands since the 80’s, and who had spent the previous several years balancing a grueling touring schedule playing drums with the garage rock trio PIERCED ARROWS and bass with Portland punk-rock destroyers P.R.O.B.L.E.M.S., and wanted to switch gears a bit. After the concept of forming a raw, real, and back-to-the-roots country band had taken hold, it wasn’t long before the couple was rehearsing a seminal set of standards by such influential early country crooners and outlaws like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Ernest Tubb, and Hank Sr., as well as a sprinkling of originals. It was only a few weeks later that Kelly’s bandmates Fred and Toody Cole got wind of the developing musical project that was taking form in Jenny and Kelly’s kitchen and decided to call their bluff by giving them an unsolicited support slot on an upcoming show featuring the Cole’s own solo two-piece act. Not having anticipated such a high-profile live appearance as a first live outing, and feeling like the guitar-and-bass-only lineup that the band had started life as was lacking something on the rhythm end of things, they decided to ask their friend Sam Henry to join them on drums. Sam, who in addition to being Jenny’s bandmate in DON’T and sometimes solo-set-collaborator, had already had a long, well respected career as one of Portland’s best drummers, having played with such first-generation punk bands as the Wipers, The Rats and Napalm Beach. After a couple of weeks of practice, the debut live appearance of the band went off without a hitch and the core lineup of Jenny Don’t And The Spurs was born.\nThe trio of Jenny, Kelly, and Sam existed in this form for the first year-an-a-half or so of the band’s existence, playing whatever local venue would take them – bars, clubs, porches, basements, backyards, and even a bookstore. This worked well for a while, and occasionally the Spurs would enlist talent from a pool of several friends to sit in on lead guitar or lap steel. The addition of a second guitar rounded out the sound of the band to the point where Jenny and Co. decided to make it a permanent part of the band’s lineup. After a couple of false starts and a bit of difficulty finding a fourth member who could commit to the Spur’s sometimes grueling touring schedule, the incredible Christopher March became a member of the family in early 2017. Christopher brought with him a wealth of talent and live gig experience, having spent years playing on the Northwest Country, Rockabilly, and Honky-Tonk circuit.\nNow, with several West Coast and North American tours, as well as three European tours and hundreds of local shows under their tooled-leather Western belts, the Spurs are gearing up for the release of their third full-length studio album. The Spurs are a musical force to be reckoned with, the intensity and energy of their live set, and dazzling Western outfits handmade by Jenny herself, the band is a must-see for anyone who enjoys spirited garage-infused country music played with sincerity and raw conviction."},{"date":"2022-05-09T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiZDE1ZWNhMWEtMjU4ZC00NjBkLWI4YzQtZmQxZTA1ZDhhNGZmIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Dehd","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Dehd/470307?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$19 advance and $23 day of show\nSOLD OUT! \nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nUpon arrival during the fraught summer of 2020, Flower of Devotion felt like Dehd’s necessary prescription for us all. That was, of course, a moment of unprecedented anxiety and uncertainty, when just contemplating the future could seem overly optimistic. But Dehd captured and shared the precarious balance between real life and real hope, a feat mirrored by instant pop melodies and infectious punk energy. The Chicago trio had the audacity to look ahead when many of us didn’t, to imagine improvement through mere existence. It was an album we needed. We need its follow-up, the triumphant Blue Skies, even more. \nDehd’s fourth album (and first for Fat Possum) is also the band’s second consecutive breakthrough, loaded with the most compelling, compulsive, and expansive songs of their career. Blue Skies offers another jolt of timely hope, only with twice the power. These 13 hits feel like flashlights in the dark, acknowledging how difficult everything from love and sex to living and dying can be while supplying the inspiration of their own experiences. “There’s a hole in my window/I was wondering how the rain was getting in,” Emily Kempf sings during the magnetic “Window,” acknowledging the problem before jubilantly exclaiming she’s moving toward something new. “Blue skies!” \nThe rapturous reception of Flower of Devotion gave Dehd access to more resources — budgets, studios, producers. Rather than seek something new, however, they invested in themselves, their process, and their deep belief in what they have always done. They booked the same studio where they had recorded Flower of Devotion but tripled their stay, giving themselves time to play with arrangements and delight in a wonderland of drum machines and synthesizers. \nThrough Dehd’s career, Jason Balla has been building his chops as a producer, so this was a chance to indulge and explore. Eric McGrady, meanwhile, considered how much more he could deliver as a drummer, adding layers to the thump of his past. And Emily, who admits that the process of making records has always been emotionally draining, focused on harnessing her indomitable energy, funneling her power into these songs without being overpowered by them. Dehd gave themselves runway to make mistakes and the space to make a statement. Blue Skies is their poignant, redemptive, and deeply fun testament to trusting and pushing yourself.\nThese 33 minutes run like a series of interconnected singles, each song so hooky and strong that you’ll be hard-pressed to name a favorite. The triumphant “Bad Love” is a surge of self-liberation, Emily leading the charge through an anthem about admitting your faults, seeking forgiveness, and finding a way forward. “I got a heart full/I got a heart full of redemption,” she offers at the start, a moment that suggests Springsteen writing with The Go-Go’s. A Tom Verlaine quiver to his voice, Jason takes a nighttime walk in the city as anxiety closes in during the irrepressible “Stars,” calming himself with a concrete reminder he’s still here. And there’s Eric’s splendid “Hold,” a chiming wonder with elastic bass lines and cascading piano parts that interlock beneath his hypnotic voice. He affirms the impact of simple acts of love.\nBut even when they sound ebullient, Dehd has never shied from troubles, the balance that has made them so magnetic. Above wafting synths and marching drum machines, “Memories” feels first like an electro dirge, memorializing lost friends. Such moments — and there are several clouds amid these Blue Skies — are pointed signals of our collective woe. Dehd presses ahead, though, into a future that offers something else if not always something better. What hope, after all, is more dependable? They end “Memories” in a refrain of pure persistence: “I’m doing all I can.” Blue Skies gets real. Blue Skies never wallows.\nToward the end of 2021, Dehd shared stages with Julien Baker, their first substantive chance to take Flower of Devotion on the road. Every night after their set, fans would tell the band how those songs had helped during the toughest times of the last two years. Those listeners had recognized what makes Emily, Jason, and Eric so compelling — they put their individual experiences on the page, then project them together with heart and empathy into instant hooks. Those post-show admissions could be a lot to process for the band, but they provided galvanizing confirmations that they’d made the right decision with Blue Skies. They would keep pulling light out of the dark with songs that feel so fucking good to hear right now. \nThe writing is sharper and smarter on Blue Skies. The harmonies and rhythms are more sophisticated and considered. The moods are deeper, the swings between them more inspiring. But this is still Dehd, just more wild and wonderful than ever before. “This is all we get,” Emily shouts with relish on the record’s last lines, during a song about the ways geologic deep time should free us all to live more. “Best to take the risk.” Heard, loud and clear."},{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiNGVjYzRiYjYtNGI2ZC00MDBkLTg2MDctOWZhMTYxMTE2YTU0IiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"HTRK","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/HTRK/465694?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$18 advance and $20 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \nPlease Note: At the Artists' request, masks are to be worn at all times (unless actively eating or drinking.) \n\nFew groups in history, recent or otherwise, elevate mood to such singular, smoldering supremacy as the Australian duo of Jonnine Standish and Nigel Yang aka HTRK [‘Hate Rock']. Across nearly two decades of work, wounds (co-founder Sean Stewart tragically took his own life in 2010), and world tours, their sound has shape-shifted between densities and intensities, noise and nakedness, but never wavered in its delicate poetic gravity. Theirs is a chemistry of smoke, echo, and the undertows of desire, the dislocation of cities and memory, the melancholy of distance and deepening night. It’s music of solitude and sensuality, for small hours and lost weekends, spoken in an intimate shadowplay language of skeletal electronics, velvet voice, and noir guitar.\nHTRK’s albums have been released by an array of international labels including Fire (Nostalgia), Blast First Petite (Marry Me Tonight), Boomkat Editions (Over The Rainbow), and Ghostly International (Psychic 9-5 Club, Venus In Leo). For the occasion of their most recent full-length, the celebrated slowburn suite Rhinestones, they founded their own artist imprint, N\u0026J Blueberries.

The duo—Andy Baxter and Kyle Jahnke—produced Olly Olly themselves, working without an outside collaborator for the first time, and the result is the purest, most authentic act of artistic self expression the pair have ever achieved.\nTexas natives Baxter and Jahnke first crossed paths at UT Austin, where they developed a fast friendship and deeply symbiotic musical connection. Beginning with 2013’s ‘Tenboom,’ the staunchly DIY pair released a series of critically lauded records that prompted NPR to praise their songwriting as a “delicate dance between heartache and resolve” and Rolling Stone to hail their catalog as “folk music for Sunday mornings, quiet evenings, and all the fragile moments in between.” The duo’s most recent album, 2019’s Finch, debuted at #2 on the Billboard Heat seekers Chart, racked up more than 40 million streams on Spotify, and earned the band their biggest headline shows to date."},{"date":"2022-05-15T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiM2NkYWU5OGQtYzMyYS00OTQxLWE4MmEtZGQ2Mzg1ZTE4MjdjIiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"Esmé Patterson","url":"https://wl.seetickets.us/event/Esm-Patterson/474595?afflky=TheChapel","details":"$18 advance and $20 day of show\nFor information on our current COVID policy, please click here. \n\nRay Bradbury’s 1950 sci-fi short story collection The Martian Chronicles takes place between 1999 and 2057. Life on earth is crumbling post-nuclear war. The robots are thriving, carrying out the duties set before them, while the humans are forced to flee to Mars. Esme Patterson’s fourth studio album, There Will Come Soft Rains, is named after the Sara Teasdale poem of the same name which inspired the Bradbury collection’s penultimate tale.\n\nThere Will Come Soft Rains revolves around the constant cycle of creation and destruction. A process that Patterson felt reflected the sonic direction she started moving in on 2016’s We Were Wild, and which she delves deeper into on her newest effort, and first for BMG. “It’s about how life continues on this planet after humans inevitably wipe ourselves out,” the Denver-based artist says. “The songs echo the surrender of starting over and failing and starting over again many times. I was hoping to convey the bittersweet peace of letting go alongside the courage to start again, being swallowed by fear and pain and coming out the other side stronger.”\nThe album follows the Grand Jury Music release of 2016’s critically acclaimed We Were Wild and marks her new partnership with BMG. Patterson got her start in the mid-aughts with her band Paper Bird and went on to release her first solo album, All Princes, I, in 2012. She began touring with Shakey Graves in 2014, in between albums and her own tours, and co-wrote three songs for his 2014 album, And The War Came, while also releasing her “defiant and witty” (The Guardian) second solo album Woman To Woman in 2015. Patterson has frequently collaborated with the likes of Craig Finn, William Elliot Whitmore, William Ryan Fitch and many more.\nPatterson’s music is constantly evolving but that has never been as obvious and crucial as it is on There Will Come Soft Rains. Jangly guitars and glowing synths build on the direction of We Were Wild and mark a stark transition from the folkier sound of her previous works. Raw vocals lay bare against fellow Denver duo Tennis’ shiny production and surfy dream pop. For the album Patterson and Tennis holed up in the band’s garage for 12 days in 2018 in the scorching hot Denver summer to record the album, but she has been conceptualizing it since 2015. “I feel like I’ve been continually rising from the ashes,” she says. “Being born and dying again.”\nOver ten songs, Patterson yearns for true love, bemoans sexual frustration and capitalism, questions the afterlife, and ponders suicidal ideation. The album opens with the ectastic “Shelby Tell Me Everything” a “sweet and innocent gay love song”. She wrote “Out The Door,” a deceptively upbeat meditation on what happens to our souls when we die, while living with her dying grandmother. The dusty and delicate guitar-led “Momentito” is about living in the present, surrendering to what we can and can’t control.\nThe darkest moment and brightest light come in the middle of the tracklist. The twinkly piano number “All Mine” takes us back to when Patterson lived in a motel room by the highway. “I was dealing with constant suicidal thoughts for several months, and through writing, writing this song specifically, I found an anchor,” she says. “I knew at the center of my being...that I was enough, that I was ok, that I could take suicide off the table permanently, and never go back, that I was fine being all mine and loneliness too shall pass, it comes and goes, and there is beauty to be found in all of it.”\nThroughout her new album Esme Patterson weaves in and out of overtly personal stories of love and loss, but true to the namesake of There Will Come Soft Rains, and in the tradition of classic sci-fi, she looks towards the future with tenacity and a passionate resolve to see what comes next. Always with an eye on the optimistic, the end of pain and struggle, Esme’s songs are imbued with acceptance and hope. Patterson knows, and wants us all to remember, that these cycles are natural, our highs compliment our lows but the beauty of life is finding balance between the two. Patterson’s There Will Come Soft Rains was released March 6th on BMG."},{"date":"2022-05-17T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d1htavafy9m5bl.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwcm9kLXNpaC5zZWV0aWNrZXRzdXNhLnVzIiwia2V5IjoiNTdiMmEzMWItZGY5Ny00YmUwLTgyZmQtMmIzYzkzYzYzMWE5IiwiZWRpdHMiOnt9fQ==","title":"!!!

It's this core plus their growth and mastery of songwriting that has seen them outlive the mid-2000s 'indie/dance punk' tag and has allowed them to consistently grow lyrically and sonically from album to album. As If is their most transcendent collection of songs yet. \"Each album we've made has gotten closer and closer to our live set and this, we're proud to say, is the closest we've come yet. We were heavily influenced by current dance music -- Nina Kraviz, Moodymann, Paranoid London, Rrose and Delroy Edwards were frequently referenced -- and philosophically by the early '90s house records we love on labels like Trax and Dancemania and by artists like Romanthony and Green Velvet. Those records sound great because they're fairly raw attempts to use the technology of the time to ape the New York and Philly disco records that those producers loved. We figured, if those old house records sound like they do because the artists manipulated disco samples with MPCs, why couldn't we just sample ourselves and manipulate the tracks with Ableton Live? The more raw it came out the better it felt, not only because that's what excited us about those old records, but because it felt more punk, which always feels good.\""}]
