From the start, they turned the ultimately rare trick of tucking inscrutable experiments into songs so infectious they became generational standards, empowering a new permissibility within a sometimes-stodgy scene. They helped make the world safe for The Grateful Dead and tie-dye, or indie rock open to the Gamelan and Juju. Influences, they implicitly insisted, matter less than the music and spirit they inspire. Such paradigm-bending lessons are now simply part of the paradigm, philosophical cornerstones of modern music. But Animal Collective have never sat still, even on the cornerstones they helped create."},{"date":"2022-06-02T00:00:00.000+00:00","url":"https://www.thewarfieldtheatre.com/events/detail/428801","img":"https://images.discovery-prod.axs.com/2022/03/griselda-tickets_06-02-22_17_6230ebda792cf.jpg","title":"GRISELDA With Westside Gunn, Conway The Machine, Benny The Butcher \u0026 Doe Boy","details":""},{"date":"2022-06-04T00:00:00.000+00:00","url":"https://www.thewarfieldtheatre.com/events/detail/423003","img":"https://images.discovery-prod.axs.com/2022/01/hayden-james-lifted-tour-tickets_06-04-22_17_61de38e2a89f8.jpg","title":"HAYDEN JAMES - LIFTED TOUR with Cassian","details":"Hayden James has been producing immense summer house jams with soulful and evocative vocals ever since he burst onto the Australian music scene in 2013.

After a few years of self-financed singles, demos and van tours, the band was signed by Sub Pop Records who subsequently released its first three full length records. \nTheir debut full length, Oh, Inverted World caused a seismic shift in the indie rock world upon its release in 2001, singlehandedly ushering in the modern era of the genre. Moved by the strength of verifiably life changing songs like “New Slang”, “Know Your Onion” and “Caring is Creepy,” a generation of artists ditched the previous decade’s lo-fi aesthetic in favor of ’s emphasis on melody.

After a show, a kid in torn jeans and a Pantera shirt, sporting ridiculous facial hair, will find one of the Streetlighters outside of the club and say hello, followed by \"Man, I don't listen to this kind of music, in fact I hate most ska bands, but you guys are something else.\" Or it will be a jazz fan, sitting in the back of the venue during the set, bobbing his head, eyes closed while the band does their thing on stage. Or one of the club's stagehands will comment, while helping break down the lighting rig, that he actually enjoyed a band he was working for for once, despite having heard thousands of bands on the job over the years. And therein lies Streetlight Manifesto's appeal."},{"date":"2022-07-29T00:00:00.000+00:00","url":"https://www.thewarfieldtheatre.com/events/detail/433013","img":"https://images.discovery-prod.axs.com/2022/05/war-on-the-catwalk_05-04-22_19_62730bf5d9d7b.jpg","title":"WAR ON THE CATWALK","details":"WAR On The Catwalk.

With the two brothers, Ross and Rocky Lynch, writing, performing, and producing all of the tracks, their stylistically unpredictable music also conjures up every romantic association with heading out on the open road: limitless possibility, the thrill of escape, a refusal to stay in one place for any real length of time.\nWith massive hooks and immaculate production, songs like \"Feel You Now\" and \"Low\" show the tight musicianship that Ross and Rocky have honed over the years in their longtime band R5-a five-piece whose self-produced 2017 EP New Addictions was praised as \"full of sharply constructed pop confections\" by Rolling Stone. It was during that band's recent worldwide tour, the two began dreaming up a new project that would allow them to explore their more experimental tendencies."},{"date":"2022-09-07T00:00:00.000+00:00","url":"https://www.thewarfieldtheatre.com/events/detail/412051","img":"https://images.discovery-prod.axs.com/2021/09/the-kid-laroi-tickets_02-03-22_17_61328d46b1b2d.jpg","title":"THE KID LAROI","details":"It’s not everyday you meet a 17-year-old with the confidence to set his sights on rap royalty and the audacity to actually attempt it. Factor in that he’s from Australia, and The Kid LAROI’s rapid ascent seems even more unlikely. But, after just one major label debut and millions of streams across platforms, the rapper born Charlton is proving that for an incoming generation filled with promising talent, yesterday’s borders aren’t today’s barriers, and anyone can make it in America as a rapper.\n  READ MORE"}]
