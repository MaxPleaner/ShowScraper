Does sound have consciousness? Can you imagine listening beyond the edge of your own imagination?\nJoin IONE, Morton Subotnick, Ramon Sender, Laurie Anderson, Aura Satz and members of the San Francisco Tape Music Center and Center for Contemporary Music to celebrate Pauline Oliveros' life and work, as well as the launch of her book Quantum Listening. IONE will lead a Sonic Meditation which will be followed by reflections and remembrances from friends of Pauline. This online event is hosted by Gray Area and Ignota Books. In response to the anti-war movements of the 1960s, pioneering musician and composer Pauline Oliveros began to expand the way she made music, experimenting with meditation, movement and activism in her compositions. Fascinated by the role that sound and consciousness play in our daily lives, Oliveros developed a series of Sonic Meditations that would eventually lead to the creation of Deep Listening. In Quantum Listening, Oliveros shows how Deep Listening is the foundation for a radically transformed social matrix: one in which compassion and peace form the basis for our actions in the world. \"Pauline has given inspiration and instructions through the depth of her listening. Her music is still resonating in quantum universes. We receive guidance from her books and essays, her keynote addresses and talks. Her graphic scores are our guiding maps. Pauline’s Quantum Listening is a clearly worded manifesto advocating for the practice of Deep Listening – the practice of practice. Accessing both the focal and the global at once makes us Futurists too, both creators and recipients of the newness, the peace and the health we long for. A champion of the underserved and underrepresented, Pauline dares us to embrace change, the unfamiliar and even the unknown. She wants us to be bold enough to imagine a benevolent society that can embrace technology to create a sublime music.\" —IONE, Quantum Listening We will be joined with remembrances by: IONE (Sonic Meditation)\nLaurie Anderson\nAura Satz\nDavid Bernstein\nAnne Bourne\nClaire Chase \u0026 Senem Pirler\nSenem Pirler \u0026 Monica Duncan\nRenko Dempster\nStuart Dempster\nAndrea Goodman\nAnne Hege\nAnne Hemenway\nBrenda Hutchinson\nRachel Koenig\nAnnea Lockwood\nNorman Lowrey\nAmy Reed\nRamon Sender (with Judy Levy-Sender)\nMorton Subotnick\nJennifer Wilsey\nPauline Oliveros (1932–2016) was a renowned American composer and performer known for conceiving a unique, meditative, improvisatory approach to music called ‘Deep Listening’®. A central figure in the development of post-war experimental and electronic music, Oliveros was the recipient of four Honorary Doctorates and many awards, including the William Schuman Award for Lifetime Achievement, Columbia University, NY; The Giga-Hertz Award for Lifetime Achievement in Electronic Music from ZKM, Center for Art and Media, Germany and The John Cage Award from from the Foundation of Contemporary Arts. During her lifetime, Oliveros was Distinguished Research Professor of Music at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, and Darius Milhaud Artist-in-Residence at Mills College.\nThe Center for Contemporary Music originated as the the Tape Music Center, created in 1961 by Pauline Oliveros, Ramon Sender and Morton Subotnick, as a counter-cultural venue for experimental artists and musicians to perform and share ressources, equipment, and knowledge.\n"},{"img":"https://i0.wp.com/grayarea.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Banner-copy.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080\u0026ssl=1","title":"Gray Area Incubator Artist Salon 2022.1","url":"https://grayarea.org/event/gray-area-incubator-artist-salon-2022-1/","date":"2022-06-15T18:00:00.000+00:00","details":"Date changed to June 15 This event was previously scheduled for May but now moved to June 15.

Learn more\nRecombinant Media Labs \u0026 Gray Area presents pioneering experimental composer and analog electronic musician Morton Subotnick in a special live performance of As I Live and Breathe, a duet of image and sound augmented with live visual animation. Subotnick has described the piece as “a fitting title as, at 88, it may be my last appearance on the road.” As I Live and Breathe combines analog recordings, electronic patches, and live performance on a hybrid Buchla 200e/Ableton “instrument” with live video animation. The work opens with the sounds of Subotnick himself breathing into a microphone: a single inhale, followed by silence, followed by an exhale. There is silence and darkness between each breath gesture, and both sound \u0026 image develop in long phrases, simply at first and gradually transforming. Morton Subotnick states, “'As I Live \u0026 Breathe' features live and sampled vocalizing along with some of my most advanced electronic performance techniques. At last, some Buchla modules are now digital plugins and Ableton Live has evolved into a form that will allow me to create a technological environment that I never expected, in my lifetime, to experience. It starts with my breath, moves through a vocalising cadenza of vocal gestures and ends with a tender and simple use of gentle rhythms and melodic fragments.\"\n"},{"img":"","title":"Grand Creative Resource Library\nSynth Sessions","url":"https://grayarea.org/event/gcrl-synth-sessions/","date":"2022-06-29T18:00:00.000+00:00","details":"June 29, 2022 6PM Mini Workshop\n7PM Group Jam Session\nFree RSVP\n(Limited capacity) Proof of vaccination is required.

Participants will expand their sonic horizons during a free hands-on workshop covering a different synthesis topic each session (drones, sequencing, sound design, etc.), then collaborate on a group jam that will propel the workshop sounds into the beyond! Participants are encouraged to bring their own electronic instrument or use one from the Grand Creative Resource Library (limited availability). Participants can also preview the instruments available from the Library and sign up to borrow one after the session. We have full modular systems, desktop synths and drum machines and a selection of Macbooks, iPads, midi controllers, and audio interfaces. The workshop begins promptly at 6pm, followed by group jam time beginning at 7pm. There will be time at the end of the workshop for general questions and advice about synthesis. Please arrive in time to set up your instrument(s) before the jam begins.\nThe Grand Creative Resource Library is a lending library offering the tools needed to create electronic music and sound art. Paired with access to workshops, labs, incubators, and events produced by the contributing partners, this collective resource will eliminate barriers to creation at the forefront of art and technology.\n\nThe Grand Creative Resource Library is a collaboration between Crowbar Corner, ZERO1, and Gray Area."}]
