Their fifth record, Mujeres, carries on the Portland-based band’s affinity for spiritual contemplation, but goes a step further in telling a story with a full emotional spectrum. Coming off Ojos Del Sol, one of NPR’s Top 50 Albums of 2016, Mujeres exhibits the scope of Mendoza’s artistic voice like never before. “Soy como soy,” Mendoza says, and that declaration is the bold— even political— statement that positions Mujeres to be Y La Bamba’s most unbridled offering yet.\n\nThe record exists in the post-2016 landscape of a national identity crisis, and Mendoza explores what it means to be a Mexican American woman by leading us through places we are afraid to go. Mujeres ventures in to the discomfort of the stories we tell ourselves. Those of our past, our futures. We all have these stories somewhere inside of us, but with Y La Bamba, Mendoza forges new narratives from old stories of heritage and family, tracing history while forging modern chicana feminism.\n\n“Music is an extension of everything I have inside. It’s how I emote,” Mendoza says. The raw honesty of Mujeres is in fact the raw honesty of Mendoza. Armed with the emotionality of traditional música mexicana and the storytelling of American folk, Y La Bamba’s artistry is not just their musical ability but Mendoza’s search for unadulterated truth. It is in an ancestral, spiritual journey in which Mendoza comes to terms with the influence and limitations of her upbringing. Mendoza’s experience of childhood summers in the San Joaquin Valley listening to mariachi, of being raised strict Catholic by immigrant parents, of being a woman having to prove herself to the boys, paints strokes of both melancholy and healing on the tracks. “From the way that my family struggles, to the way they shoot the shit… it’s so different from whiteness,” Mendoza says. “It’s a different dimension.”\n\nY La Bamba exists in the dimension of the Mexican American imagination: somewhere cynical and optimistic at the same time. While there is a celebration of the Mexican creativity that has informed Mendoza’s life, there is a darker side to reconcile with. Where do mujeres fit in to the American story? What are the sins for which we are all guilty? How do different generations interact with the world? How can a culture become visible without tokenization? It is no surprise that in Mujeres, Y La Bamba’s first record with Mendoza at the helm of production, Mendoza contemplates these questions to tell her story. But it is not just Mendoza’s story.

Every Monday at noon for ninety minute at the wonderful Freight  \u0026 Salvage in Berkeley.\nBobby first developed Circlesongs in his now legendary solo a cappella performances, when he needed  other voices to help manifest his musical ideas. He gave the audience parts to sing, layering harmonies  and rhythms, using call and response, conducting and composing his spontaneous inventions. During  his years of worldwide touring, he evolved a variety of vocal groups beginning in the ‘80’s with his Bay  Area based group Voicestra. \nBobby’s Circlesongs concerts celebrated all the kinds of music that would spontaneously emerge from  anywhere in his stream-of-consciousness, like maybe from Americana or classical, R\u0026B, gospel, folk,  pop, rock, beatboxing—combined with any sound he could imagine. For Bobby, Circlesongs is not a concert or a performance… it is a service to create a singing space that is without words, genres or pre existing knowledge. There is a place in the circle for everyone. \nThese sessions will be hosted by David Worm, an original member of both Bobby’s Voicestra and  Gimme5, and a diversely gifted team of celebrated Bay Area singers. Including Bryan Dyer, Destani  Wolf, Tammi Brown and others. Bobby has recently moved back to San Francisco from Philadelphia  and is really excited to begin to create with these wonderful singers. \n“Bobby McFerrin’s greatest gift to his audience may be changing them from spectators  into celebrants and transforming a concert hall into a playground, a village center, a  joyous space.” – Los Angeles Times \nBobby McFerrin is an inspiration to singers around the world who celebrate his innovative technique  and spirit. His solo performances and collaborations with great artists—including Yo-Yo Ma, Chick  Corea, and the Vienna Philharmonic—are the stuff of legend. Along the way, there were 10 Grammy  Awards and a #1 global hit “Don’t Worry, Be Happy.” bobbymcferrin.com \n“Bobby McFerrin is an artist whose blinding originality has set him on a course that has  no maps but is awash with possibilities lurking in every curve of the road… sheer joy in  the elemental beauty of the voice… celebrates music as a primal essence, as crucial to  our sense of ourselves as breathing” – The Irish Times"},{"date":"2022-06-07T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2021/06/25113102/TommyEmanuel.jpg","title":"Tommy Emmanuel, CGP","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/513/tommy-emmanuel-7","details":"Richard Smith opens\n\n\"Songs are our teachers.

The first, predictably, is his extraordinary guitar playing. Considered by those in the know to be among this planet’s greatest guitarists, his playing is simply miraculous, as it would take three musicians, or more, to do what Tommy does solo. Who else, for example, when playing “Day Tripper,” can lay down the rhythm part, dig into the riff and sing the melody all at once on just one acoustic guitar? \n\nWhich brings us to the other aspect of his music always mentioned, and without which the first might not be as powerful or as infectiously appealing: the joy. Yes, joy. Because it’s one thing to play these multi-dimensional arrangements flawlessly on an acoustic guitar.

I can't help but play to the people with all my heart, which is overflowing with joy of being in that moment that I’ve worked all my life for. And here it is!”\n            \nAlthough his expression is instrumental, he comes to the guitar much more like a vocalist, positively singing melodies through the strings. He inhabits the tunes he performs, delivering every nuance and turn of phrase. His own songs are also illuminated always with lyrical melodies that go right to the heart, such as his beautiful ode to his daughter, “Angelina,” or his great “story without words,” “Lewis \u0026 Clark.” That they resonate so deeply without words makes sense, as words only go so far. But music, coming from a genuine and joyful source, can go so much farther.

He received a a degree in music from UC Berkeley where he studied with Andrew Imbrie and others.\n\nHe began playing and recording on an international level as a member of Peter Apfelbaum’s Hieroglyphics Ensemble,who made their recorded debut with Don Cherry on “Multikulti” (A\u0026M 1989). Since then, Bernard has participated in a host of boundary stretching groups, ranging from jazz, hip-hop and world music to experimental music, with many stops in between. In the 90’s Bernard recorded and performed with many projects under the direction of acclaimed producer Lee Townsend and worked with groups ranging from the Hindustani-influenced Jai Uttal to the political hip-hop group the Coup. The most commercially successful of these projects was the group T.J. Kirk (with Charlie Hunter) whose sophomore album “If Four Was One” on Warner bros. was nominated for a Grammy in 1997. Will made further inroads with the Stanton Moore trio which toured extensively and made 3 albums on Telarc and a Hal Leonard drum instructional video and book.\n\nBernard broke out as a bandleader in 1998 with the release of “Medicine Hat” (Antilles/Polygram), showcasing his expert chops and flair for funky, bottom-heavy soul-jazz. He then followed up with two self produced albums (“Motherbug” and “Directions To My House”), before making two albums on Palmetto Records (“Party Hats” and “Blue Plate Special”). “Party Hats” garnered a nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008 for best contemporary jazz album.The all-star “Blue Plate Special” includes performances by Stanton Moore, Andy Hess and John Medeski. In 2011, Bernard released an organ trio record titled “Outdoor Living” to positive reviews with his own genre-bending style.\n\nBernard’s last two albums are on Posi-tone records  “Just Like Downtown” (Posi-Tone 2013) which features John Ellis on tenor sax and bass clarinet, Brian Charette on organ, and Rudy Royston on drums and “Out and About” (2016). which features Ben Allison, Allison Miller, Brian Charette and John Ellis. These recordings  demonstrates Bernard’s roots in straight-ahead jazz and more traditional styles as well as funk and free wheeling improv.\nWebsite | Facebook"},{"date":"2022-06-10T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2022/03/08150435/Steel-House.jpg","title":"Steel House\nfeat. Edward Simon, Scott Colley, and Brian Blade","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/11341/steel-house","details":"Featuring Venezuelan-born pianist Edward Simon, bassist Scott Colley and drummer Brian Blade, Steel House brings together three of jazz’s most sought-after accompanists.\n\nSimon, Blade and Colley seek out a new context for their collaboration where they could cultivate “a certain aesthetic, a sensitivity and melodic sense the three of us gravitate toward,” Colley says. “We’ve played so much as a rhythm section for other musicians and composers. We wanted to get together to explore the different textures and things that we gravitate towards instinctively. One of the things for sure is a real melodic sense, and a degree of patience that I see in Edward and Brian.”\n\nRather than adding another piano, bass and drums trio into the jazz mix, Steel House has turned into a home for lyrical compositions that often feel like fleshed-out songs more than jazz tunes. Simon artfully contributes keyboard textures, subtle production touches that accentuate the music’s lithe lyricism without weighing it down.\n\n“We’ve played at the Village Vanguard and did it completely acoustic, so we can go in that direction,” Simon says. “But when you hear the record, you can hear we’re writing songs, a little more produced. Not pop production, but definitely that element. I think we’ll continue that direction on the next record.”\n\nSteel House is the latest destination for Simon, whose epic musical journey started in 1984 at the age of 15, when he left his home in Punta Cardón, Venezuela, and moved by himself to Pennsylvania. His father, philosopher Hadsy Simon, thought his music-loving middle son’s best chance to thrive was in the U.S. Enrolled at the Philadelphia Performing Arts School, he discovered jazz, and eventually connected with Philly masters bassist Charles Fambrough and guitarist Kevin Eubanks, who encouraged the young pianist’s move to New York.\n\nLanding in Manhattan in 1988, Simon quickly established himself as an essential new voice through touring and recording with altoist Bobby Watson and trumpeter Terence Blanchard. At the center of a wave of brilliant Latin American musicians who transformed the New York scene in the 1990s with influences beyond Cuba and Brazil, Simon recorded a series of acclaimed albums documenting his ambition as a composer.\n\nNamed one of the best releases of the year in the NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll, Simon’s latest album, 2018’s Sorrows \u0026 Triumphs, features his quartet Afinidad with Blade and Colley, and the Imani Winds, an exploratory quintet known for collaborations with jazz masters Wayne Shorter, Paquito D’Rivera, and Jason Moran. Steel House offers a very different path, avoiding the tropes and forms that define so many jazz trios. Rather than focusing on accompaniment, Colley often takes the lead. And instead of a theme followed by a string of solos, the music unfolds via extended ensemble passages that barely require solos at all.\n\n“You start to feel confined by those roles and categories,” Simon says. “After a while you outgrow them. You want to be free to do something completely different. There should be space for all of that.”\nEdward Simon | Scott Colley | Brian Blade "},{"date":"2022-06-11T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2021/06/30115640/JohnMcCutcheon.jpg","title":"An Evening with John McCutcheon","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/564/john-mccutcheon","details":"No one remembers when the neighbors started calling the McCutcheons to complain about the loud singing from young John's bedroom. It didn't seem to do much good, though. For, after a shaky, lopsided battle between piano lessons and baseball (he was a mediocre pianist and an all-star catcher), he had \"found his voice\" thanks to a cheap mail-order guitar and a used book of chords.\n\nThe Washington Post described John as folk music's \"Rustic Renaissance Man,\" a moniker flawed only by its understatement. \"Calling John McCutcheon a 'folksinger' is like saying Deion Sanders is just a football player...\" (Dallas Morning News). Besides his usual circuit of major concert halls and theaters, John is equally at home in an elementary school auditorium, a festival stage or at a farm rally. He is a whirlwind of energy packing five lifetimes into one. In the past few years alone he has headlined over a dozen different festivals in North America (including repeated performances at the National Storytelling Festival), recorded an original composition for Virginia Public Television involving over 500 musicians, toured Australia for the sixth time, toured Chile in support of a women's health initiative, appeared in a Woody Guthrie tribute concert in New York City, gave a featured concert at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, taught performance art skills at a North Carolina college, given symphony pops concerts across America, served as President of the fastest-growing Local in the Musicians Union and performed a special concert at the National Baseball Hall of Fame. This is all in his \"spare time.\" His \"real job,\" he's quick to point out, is father to two grown sons.\n\nBut it is in live performance that John feels most at home. It is what has brought his music into the lives and homes of one of the broadest audiences any folk musician has ever enjoyed. People of every generation and background seem to feel at home in a concert hall when John McCutcheon takes the stage, with what critics describe as \"little feats of magic,\" \"breathtaking in their ease and grace...,\" and \"like a conversation with an illuminating old friend.\"\n\nWhether in print, on record, or on stage, few people communicate with the versatility, charm, wit or pure talent of John McCutcheon.\n\nWebsite | Facebook"},{"date":"2022-06-12T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2022/02/03184450/Suzzy-Roche-Lucy-Wainwright-Roche-I-Can-Still-Hear-You.jpg","title":"Suzzy Roche \u0026 Lucy Wainwright Roche","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/11194/suzzy-roche-and-lucy-wainwright-roche","details":"Suzzy Roche and Lucy Wainwright Roche released their lastest recording I Can Still Hear You in the fall of 2020.  The album was largely recorded in the darkest hours of the Covid shutdown in the spring of 2020 in NYC.  After starting the recording in Nashville, with producer Jordan Hamlin, the mother/daughter team went back to New York City just as the city closed up.  They set up studios in their bedrooms: Lucy in Brooklyn, Suzzy in Manhattan, and finished the record.  Hailed as “one of the year’s best” by Americana Highways, the new album has been met with high praise. Suzzy and Lucy have recorded two albums previously, Fairytale \u0026 Myth (Independent Music Award winner) and Mud \u0026 Apples (also nominated for IMA).\n\nThose familiar with Lucy Wainwright Roche are aware of her bell tone voice, her unshakable melodies, and her knack for wise, wry lyrics. It’s no surprise that Wainwright Roche is the daughter of Suzzy Roche (The Roches) and Loudon Wainwright III, half sibling to Rufus and Martha Wainwright.  Lucy has carved out her own career as a touring singer/songwriter and recording artist, with five critically acclaimed solo recordings released on her own label: Eight Songs, Eight More, Lucy, There’s a Last Time for Everything and her most recent Little Beast (Winner of the Independent Music Award for Best Singer/Songwriter.)  Other recordings include a collaboration with her sister Martha Wainwright on Songs In the Dark, a collection of lullabies. For over a decade, as a solo act, armed with a guitar, a deadpan sense of humor, insightful songs, and a voice that makes tough guys cry, she’s built a solid following across the US and Europe.  As an opening act she has often appeared with such luminaries as The Indigo Girls, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Neko Case, and she’s one of a few who can step out alone in front of a thousand strangers and play an entire set to a rapt audience.\n\nSuzzy Roche is a singer/songwriter/performer/author and founding member of the singing group The Roches.  She has recorded over eighteen albums, written music for TV and Film, and toured extensively for forty years across the U.S. and Europe. She has performed with the experimental theater troupe, The Wooster Group, for over twenty years. Her children’s book Want To Be In A Band (Random House) was published in February 2013.  Wayward Saints (Hyperion/Voice) is her first novel and was a selection of the Spring 2012 B\u0026N Discover Great New Writers Program. Her most recent novel The Town Crazy was published in August of 2020.\nSuzzy Roche | Lucy Wainwright Roche\nPhoto: Shervin Lainez"},{"date":"2022-06-13T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2021/06/24082841/Bobby-McFerrin.jpg","title":"Bobby McFerrin\nCirclesongs\nHost: David Worm \u0026 Motion","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/10848/bobby-mcferrin-0613","details":"“You get people together and get them singing, and you instantly knock down all the  walls – the creeds, the gender, age and race differences, everything.

Every Monday at noon for ninety minute at the wonderful Freight  \u0026 Salvage in Berkeley.\nBobby first developed Circlesongs in his now legendary solo a cappella performances, when he needed  other voices to help manifest his musical ideas. He gave the audience parts to sing, layering harmonies  and rhythms, using call and response, conducting and composing his spontaneous inventions. During  his years of worldwide touring, he evolved a variety of vocal groups beginning in the ‘80’s with his Bay  Area based group Voicestra. \nBobby’s Circlesongs concerts celebrated all the kinds of music that would spontaneously emerge from  anywhere in his stream-of-consciousness, like maybe from Americana or classical, R\u0026B, gospel, folk,  pop, rock, beatboxing—combined with any sound he could imagine. For Bobby, Circlesongs is not a concert or a performance… it is a service to create a singing space that is without words, genres or pre existing knowledge. There is a place in the circle for everyone. \nThese sessions will be hosted by David Worm, an original member of both Bobby’s Voicestra and  Gimme5, and a diversely gifted team of celebrated Bay Area singers. Including Bryan Dyer, Destani  Wolf, Tammi Brown and others. Bobby has recently moved back to San Francisco from Philadelphia  and is really excited to begin to create with these wonderful singers. \n“Bobby McFerrin’s greatest gift to his audience may be changing them from spectators  into celebrants and transforming a concert hall into a playground, a village center, a  joyous space.” – Los Angeles Times \nBobby McFerrin is an inspiration to singers around the world who celebrate his innovative technique  and spirit. His solo performances and collaborations with great artists—including Yo-Yo Ma, Chick  Corea, and the Vienna Philharmonic—are the stuff of legend. Along the way, there were 10 Grammy  Awards and a #1 global hit “Don’t Worry, Be Happy.” bobbymcferrin.com \n“Bobby McFerrin is an artist whose blinding originality has set him on a course that has  no maps but is awash with possibilities lurking in every curve of the road… sheer joy in  the elemental beauty of the voice… celebrates music as a primal essence, as crucial to  our sense of ourselves as breathing” – The Irish Times"},{"date":"2022-06-14T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2022/02/23095740/BerkeleyChoro.jpg","title":"8th Annual Berkeley Festival of Choro","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/11256/berkeley-festival-of-choro","details":"The 8th annual Berkeley Festival of Choro presents Brazilian choro in chamber music. \nCurating a wide array of choro over the years, the Berkeley Festival of Choro is taking a fresh look at where the beloved Brazilian genre can go.
