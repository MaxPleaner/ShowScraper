Pickles and ice cream, anyone?\n\nSince its launch in 1997, The Moth has presented thousands of stories told live and without notes.\nMoth shows are renowned for the great range of human experience they showcase. Each show starts with a theme, and the storytellers explore it, often in unexpected ways. Since each story is true and every voice authentic, the shows dance between documentary and theater, creating a unique, intimate, and often enlightening experience for the audience.\nThe Moth was founded by the novelist George Dawes Green, who wanted to recreate in New York the feeling of sultry summer evenings in his native Georgia, when moths were attracted to the light on the porch where he and his friends would gather to spin spellbinding tales. The first New York Moth event was held in George’s living room and the story events quickly spread to larger venues throughout the city.\nThrough ongoing programs in more than 29 cities, The Moth has presented over 30,000 stories to standing-room-only crowds worldwide and it currently produces more than 500 live shows each year. Additionally, The Moth runs storytelling workshops for high school students and adults in underserved communities through their Education and Community Programs.\nThe Moth has an enthusiastic following for all of its content. The Moth podcast is downloaded more than 50 million times a year, and each week, the Peabody Award-winning Moth Radio Hour is heard on over 480 radio stations worldwide.

Every Monday at noon for ninety minute at the wonderful Freight  \u0026 Salvage in Berkeley.\nBobby first developed Circlesongs in his now legendary solo a cappella performances, when he needed  other voices to help manifest his musical ideas. He gave the audience parts to sing, layering harmonies  and rhythms, using call and response, conducting and composing his spontaneous inventions. During  his years of worldwide touring, he evolved a variety of vocal groups beginning in the ‘80’s with his Bay  Area based group Voicestra. \nBobby’s Circlesongs concerts celebrated all the kinds of music that would spontaneously emerge from  anywhere in his stream-of-consciousness, like maybe from Americana or classical, R\u0026B, gospel, folk,  pop, rock, beatboxing—combined with any sound he could imagine. For Bobby, Circlesongs is not a concert or a performance… it is a service to create a singing space that is without words, genres or pre existing knowledge. There is a place in the circle for everyone. \nThese sessions will be hosted by David Worm, an original member of both Bobby’s Voicestra and  Gimme5, and a diversely gifted team of celebrated Bay Area singers. Including Bryan Dyer, Destani  Wolf, Tammi Brown and others. Bobby has recently moved back to San Francisco from Philadelphia  and is really excited to begin to create with these wonderful singers. \n“Bobby McFerrin’s greatest gift to his audience may be changing them from spectators  into celebrants and transforming a concert hall into a playground, a village center, a  joyous space.” – Los Angeles Times \nBobby McFerrin is an inspiration to singers around the world who celebrate his innovative technique  and spirit.

Tasjan! Tasjan!, the new album from Aaron Lee Tasjan, a genre-bending rising star who’s bold reimagination of classic sounds and songwriting has established him as one of the most idiosyncratic artists of his generation.\nHis self-titled fourth album is a masterclass in interstellar pop, vintage glam, 90s Anglophilia and experimental and psychedelic rock \u0026 roll. Irreverent lyrics may show Tasjan with his tongue in his cheek, but Tasjan! Tasjan! Tasjan! is an album with something to say. His autobiographical lyrics reflect on self-acceptance, expose his own contradictions and offer a unique self-deprecating critique on the millennial generation’s simultaneous capacity for great empathy and narcissism. The album also explores notions of mental health, identity and sexuality and is dedicated to the alternative kids who also felt “other” growing up.\nTasjan has been on a shapeshifting musical journey his whole life. From his glam rock roots, when Jimmy Iovine told him “guys in make-up don’t sell records” and Lady Gaga would open for his band in NYC, to his legend-hopping guitar sideman days, where he played with everyone from The New York Dolls to Sean Lennon and traveled the globe, collecting road war tales from doing mushrooms with Bono to twitter spats with Peter Frampton.\nWebsite | Facebook\n\n\nJesse Daniel Edwards is an acclaimed songwriter hailing from the small mountain town of Cuyamaca, CA (pop. 60). As a child, Jesse and his 6 siblings grew up without television, internet, or significant exposure to the outside world. He spent his time learning to sing harmony to gospel tracks and tinkering on hand-me-down instruments with his grandpa. Leaving home at 16, he spent his late teen years busking on street corners around the US and abroad. He eventually grew to perform upon the festival and university circuits full-time after a chance encounter with Al Bunetta (Oh Boy Records), sharing the stage with Morrissey, Lucinda Williams, and John Prine. His songs have been featured in radio, TV, streaming movies, video games, and film.

Sometimes he reads mystical poetry in his own language, speaks in tongues, channels aliens, throat-sings, beat-boxes, or does skits as different characters such as Negative Ralph, Country Bob, The Goblin, or Guru Fafa which he has a right to embody because of his half-indian heritage.\nSomewhat of an acrobat, Rushad can spin on one leg, hang upside down, do splits, play in plough pose, and catch flying fruits in his mouth while playing fast intricate cello rhythms.  A distinguished flatpicker, his innovation and skill are admired by many guitar luminaries. Although some of his music is avant garde and experimental (he has an amazing deathmetal cat-voice), he is an expert at making personal anthems to those for which he is playing.\nWebsite | Facebook"},{"date":"2022-05-12T19:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2022/03/08092640/VieuxDeNiafunke%CC%81.jpg","title":"Vieux de Niafunké: Sharing Culture Through Music","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/11333/vieux-de-niafunke","details":"Media1044 and Ian Campbell are proud to announce the release of Vieux de Niafunké, a full length documentary featuring the life and music of Vieux Farka Touré, arguably the greatest African guitarist of his generation.\n\nThe film follows Vieux from his home in Mali on a tour du monde that is a visual and sonic feast. Exploring the influence of Vieux’slegendary father, Ali Farka Touré, the documentary examines Vieux’s evolution as a musician and cultural ambassador in his own right. Vieux continues to break boundaries, moving seamlessly between blues, funk, reggae and rock music. His passion for music is clear, “You can’t choose music to be a job. Music has to choose you. To make people happy is why I’m here – it’s what I have to do,” says Vieux.\n\nVieux is an anti-celebrity who, despite worldwide fame, stays true to his roots and close to his family in Niafunke, the wind-swept, sun-baked, mud-toned village he grew up in on the Niger River.

He is the son of legendary Malian guitar player Ali Farka Touré, who died in 2006. Ali Farka Touré came from a historical tribe of soldiers, and defied his parents in becoming a musician. When Vieux was in his teens, he declared that he also wanted to be a musician. His father disapproved due to the pressures he had experienced being a musician. Rather, he wanted Vieux to become a soldier. But with help from family friend the kora maestro Toumani Diabaté, Vieux eventually convinced his father to give him his blessing to become a musician shortly before Ali passed.\nVieux was initially a drummer / calabash player at Mali’s Institut National des Arts, but secretly began playing guitar in 2001. Ali Farka Touré was weakened with cancer when Vieux announced that he was going to record an album. Ali recorded a couple of tracks with him, and these recordings, which can be heard on Vieux’s debut CD, were amongst his final ones. It has been said that the senior Touré played rough mixes of these songs when people visited him in his final days, at peace with, and proud of, his son’s talent as a musician.\nWebsite | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | YouTube"},{"date":"2022-05-14T19:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2022/02/12094429/CrisWilliamson2022.jpg","title":"Cris Williamson CD Release Celebration of Harbor Street","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/10828/cris-williamson-514","details":"Celebrating the release of her new album, Harbor Street, Cris and friends will bring us this new music, twelve originals, mostly composed during the pandemic and recorded right here in Berkeley at Opus Studios.
