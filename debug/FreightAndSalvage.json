Their fifth record, Mujeres, carries on the Portland-based band’s affinity for spiritual contemplation, but goes a step further in telling a story with a full emotional spectrum. Coming off Ojos Del Sol, one of NPR’s Top 50 Albums of 2016, Mujeres exhibits the scope of Mendoza’s artistic voice like never before. “Soy como soy,” Mendoza says, and that declaration is the bold— even political— statement that positions Mujeres to be Y La Bamba’s most unbridled offering yet.\n\nThe record exists in the post-2016 landscape of a national identity crisis, and Mendoza explores what it means to be a Mexican American woman by leading us through places we are afraid to go. Mujeres ventures in to the discomfort of the stories we tell ourselves. Those of our past, our futures. We all have these stories somewhere inside of us, but with Y La Bamba, Mendoza forges new narratives from old stories of heritage and family, tracing history while forging modern chicana feminism.\n\n“Music is an extension of everything I have inside. It’s how I emote,” Mendoza says. The raw honesty of Mujeres is in fact the raw honesty of Mendoza. Armed with the emotionality of traditional música mexicana and the storytelling of American folk, Y La Bamba’s artistry is not just their musical ability but Mendoza’s search for unadulterated truth. It is in an ancestral, spiritual journey in which Mendoza comes to terms with the influence and limitations of her upbringing. Mendoza’s experience of childhood summers in the San Joaquin Valley listening to mariachi, of being raised strict Catholic by immigrant parents, of being a woman having to prove herself to the boys, paints strokes of both melancholy and healing on the tracks. “From the way that my family struggles, to the way they shoot the shit… it’s so different from whiteness,” Mendoza says. “It’s a different dimension.”\n\nY La Bamba exists in the dimension of the Mexican American imagination: somewhere cynical and optimistic at the same time. While there is a celebration of the Mexican creativity that has informed Mendoza’s life, there is a darker side to reconcile with. Where do mujeres fit in to the American story? What are the sins for which we are all guilty? How do different generations interact with the world? How can a culture become visible without tokenization? It is no surprise that in Mujeres, Y La Bamba’s first record with Mendoza at the helm of production, Mendoza contemplates these questions to tell her story. But it is not just Mendoza’s story.

Every Monday at noon for ninety minute at the wonderful Freight  \u0026 Salvage in Berkeley.\nBobby first developed Circlesongs in his now legendary solo a cappella performances, when he needed  other voices to help manifest his musical ideas. He gave the audience parts to sing, layering harmonies  and rhythms, using call and response, conducting and composing his spontaneous inventions. During  his years of worldwide touring, he evolved a variety of vocal groups beginning in the ‘80’s with his Bay  Area based group Voicestra. \nBobby’s Circlesongs concerts celebrated all the kinds of music that would spontaneously emerge from  anywhere in his stream-of-consciousness, like maybe from Americana or classical, R\u0026B, gospel, folk,  pop, rock, beatboxing—combined with any sound he could imagine. For Bobby, Circlesongs is not a concert or a performance… it is a service to create a singing space that is without words, genres or pre existing knowledge. There is a place in the circle for everyone. \nThese sessions will be hosted by David Worm, an original member of both Bobby’s Voicestra and  Gimme5, and a diversely gifted team of celebrated Bay Area singers. Including Bryan Dyer, Destani  Wolf, Tammi Brown and others. Bobby has recently moved back to San Francisco from Philadelphia  and is really excited to begin to create with these wonderful singers. \n“Bobby McFerrin’s greatest gift to his audience may be changing them from spectators  into celebrants and transforming a concert hall into a playground, a village center, a  joyous space.” – Los Angeles Times \nBobby McFerrin is an inspiration to singers around the world who celebrate his innovative technique  and spirit. His solo performances and collaborations with great artists—including Yo-Yo Ma, Chick  Corea, and the Vienna Philharmonic—are the stuff of legend. Along the way, there were 10 Grammy  Awards and a #1 global hit “Don’t Worry, Be Happy.” bobbymcferrin.com \n“Bobby McFerrin is an artist whose blinding originality has set him on a course that has  no maps but is awash with possibilities lurking in every curve of the road… sheer joy in  the elemental beauty of the voice… celebrates music as a primal essence, as crucial to  our sense of ourselves as breathing” – The Irish Times"},{"date":"2022-06-07T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2021/06/25113102/TommyEmanuel.jpg","title":"Tommy Emmanuel, CGP","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/513/tommy-emmanuel-7","details":"Richard Smith opens\n\n\"Songs are our teachers.

The first, predictably, is his extraordinary guitar playing. Considered by those in the know to be among this planet’s greatest guitarists, his playing is simply miraculous, as it would take three musicians, or more, to do what Tommy does solo. Who else, for example, when playing “Day Tripper,” can lay down the rhythm part, dig into the riff and sing the melody all at once on just one acoustic guitar? \n\nWhich brings us to the other aspect of his music always mentioned, and without which the first might not be as powerful or as infectiously appealing: the joy. Yes, joy. Because it’s one thing to play these multi-dimensional arrangements flawlessly on an acoustic guitar.

I can't help but play to the people with all my heart, which is overflowing with joy of being in that moment that I’ve worked all my life for. And here it is!”\n            \nAlthough his expression is instrumental, he comes to the guitar much more like a vocalist, positively singing melodies through the strings. He inhabits the tunes he performs, delivering every nuance and turn of phrase. His own songs are also illuminated always with lyrical melodies that go right to the heart, such as his beautiful ode to his daughter, “Angelina,” or his great “story without words,” “Lewis \u0026 Clark.” That they resonate so deeply without words makes sense, as words only go so far. But music, coming from a genuine and joyful source, can go so much farther.

He received a a degree in music from UC Berkeley where he studied with Andrew Imbrie and others.\n\nHe began playing and recording on an international level as a member of Peter Apfelbaum’s Hieroglyphics Ensemble,who made their recorded debut with Don Cherry on “Multikulti” (A\u0026M 1989). Since then, Bernard has participated in a host of boundary stretching groups, ranging from jazz, hip-hop and world music to experimental music, with many stops in between. In the 90’s Bernard recorded and performed with many projects under the direction of acclaimed producer Lee Townsend and worked with groups ranging from the Hindustani-influenced Jai Uttal to the political hip-hop group the Coup. The most commercially successful of these projects was the group T.J. Kirk (with Charlie Hunter) whose sophomore album “If Four Was One” on Warner bros. was nominated for a Grammy in 1997. Will made further inroads with the Stanton Moore trio which toured extensively and made 3 albums on Telarc and a Hal Leonard drum instructional video and book.\n\nBernard broke out as a bandleader in 1998 with the release of “Medicine Hat” (Antilles/Polygram), showcasing his expert chops and flair for funky, bottom-heavy soul-jazz. He then followed up with two self produced albums (“Motherbug” and “Directions To My House”), before making two albums on Palmetto Records (“Party Hats” and “Blue Plate Special”). “Party Hats” garnered a nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008 for best contemporary jazz album.The all-star “Blue Plate Special” includes performances by Stanton Moore, Andy Hess and John Medeski. In 2011, Bernard released an organ trio record titled “Outdoor Living” to positive reviews with his own genre-bending style.\n\nBernard’s last two albums are on Posi-tone records  “Just Like Downtown” (Posi-Tone 2013) which features John Ellis on tenor sax and bass clarinet, Brian Charette on organ, and Rudy Royston on drums and “Out and About” (2016). which features Ben Allison, Allison Miller, Brian Charette and John Ellis. These recordings  demonstrates Bernard’s roots in straight-ahead jazz and more traditional styles as well as funk and free wheeling improv.\nWebsite | Facebook"},{"date":"2022-06-10T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2022/03/08150435/Steel-House.jpg","title":"Steel House\nfeat. Edward Simon, Scott Colley, and Brian Blade","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/11341/steel-house","details":"Featuring Venezuelan-born pianist Edward Simon, bassist Scott Colley and drummer Brian Blade, Steel House brings together three of jazz’s most sought-after accompanists.\n\nSimon, Blade and Colley seek out a new context for their collaboration where they could cultivate “a certain aesthetic, a sensitivity and melodic sense the three of us gravitate toward,” Colley says. “We’ve played so much as a rhythm section for other musicians and composers. We wanted to get together to explore the different textures and things that we gravitate towards instinctively. One of the things for sure is a real melodic sense, and a degree of patience that I see in Edward and Brian.”\n\nRather than adding another piano, bass and drums trio into the jazz mix, Steel House has turned into a home for lyrical compositions that often feel like fleshed-out songs more than jazz tunes. Simon artfully contributes keyboard textures, subtle production touches that accentuate the music’s lithe lyricism without weighing it down.\n\n“We’ve played at the Village Vanguard and did it completely acoustic, so we can go in that direction,” Simon says. “But when you hear the record, you can hear we’re writing songs, a little more produced. Not pop production, but definitely that element. I think we’ll continue that direction on the next record.”\n\nSteel House is the latest destination for Simon, whose epic musical journey started in 1984 at the age of 15, when he left his home in Punta Cardón, Venezuela, and moved by himself to Pennsylvania. His father, philosopher Hadsy Simon, thought his music-loving middle son’s best chance to thrive was in the U.S. Enrolled at the Philadelphia Performing Arts School, he discovered jazz, and eventually connected with Philly masters bassist Charles Fambrough and guitarist Kevin Eubanks, who encouraged the young pianist’s move to New York.\n\nLanding in Manhattan in 1988, Simon quickly established himself as an essential new voice through touring and recording with altoist Bobby Watson and trumpeter Terence Blanchard. At the center of a wave of brilliant Latin American musicians who transformed the New York scene in the 1990s with influences beyond Cuba and Brazil, Simon recorded a series of acclaimed albums documenting his ambition as a composer.\n\nNamed one of the best releases of the year in the NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll, Simon’s latest album, 2018’s Sorrows \u0026 Triumphs, features his quartet Afinidad with Blade and Colley, and the Imani Winds, an exploratory quintet known for collaborations with jazz masters Wayne Shorter, Paquito D’Rivera, and Jason Moran. Steel House offers a very different path, avoiding the tropes and forms that define so many jazz trios. Rather than focusing on accompaniment, Colley often takes the lead. And instead of a theme followed by a string of solos, the music unfolds via extended ensemble passages that barely require solos at all.\n\n“You start to feel confined by those roles and categories,” Simon says. “After a while you outgrow them. You want to be free to do something completely different. There should be space for all of that.”\nEdward Simon | Scott Colley | Brian Blade "},{"date":"2022-06-11T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2021/06/30115640/JohnMcCutcheon.jpg","title":"An Evening with John McCutcheon","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/564/john-mccutcheon","details":"No one remembers when the neighbors started calling the McCutcheons to complain about the loud singing from young John's bedroom. It didn't seem to do much good, though. For, after a shaky, lopsided battle between piano lessons and baseball (he was a mediocre pianist and an all-star catcher), he had \"found his voice\" thanks to a cheap mail-order guitar and a used book of chords.\n\nThe Washington Post described John as folk music's \"Rustic Renaissance Man,\" a moniker flawed only by its understatement. \"Calling John McCutcheon a 'folksinger' is like saying Deion Sanders is just a football player...\" (Dallas Morning News). Besides his usual circuit of major concert halls and theaters, John is equally at home in an elementary school auditorium, a festival stage or at a farm rally. He is a whirlwind of energy packing five lifetimes into one. In the past few years alone he has headlined over a dozen different festivals in North America (including repeated performances at the National Storytelling Festival), recorded an original composition for Virginia Public Television involving over 500 musicians, toured Australia for the sixth time, toured Chile in support of a women's health initiative, appeared in a Woody Guthrie tribute concert in New York City, gave a featured concert at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, taught performance art skills at a North Carolina college, given symphony pops concerts across America, served as President of the fastest-growing Local in the Musicians Union and performed a special concert at the National Baseball Hall of Fame. This is all in his \"spare time.\" His \"real job,\" he's quick to point out, is father to two grown sons.\n\nBut it is in live performance that John feels most at home. It is what has brought his music into the lives and homes of one of the broadest audiences any folk musician has ever enjoyed. People of every generation and background seem to feel at home in a concert hall when John McCutcheon takes the stage, with what critics describe as \"little feats of magic,\" \"breathtaking in their ease and grace...,\" and \"like a conversation with an illuminating old friend.\"\n\nWhether in print, on record, or on stage, few people communicate with the versatility, charm, wit or pure talent of John McCutcheon.\n\nWebsite | Facebook"},{"date":"2022-06-12T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2022/02/03184450/Suzzy-Roche-Lucy-Wainwright-Roche-I-Can-Still-Hear-You.jpg","title":"Suzzy Roche \u0026 Lucy Wainwright Roche","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/11194/suzzy-roche-and-lucy-wainwright-roche","details":"Suzzy Roche and Lucy Wainwright Roche released their lastest recording I Can Still Hear You in the fall of 2020.  The album was largely recorded in the darkest hours of the Covid shutdown in the spring of 2020 in NYC.  After starting the recording in Nashville, with producer Jordan Hamlin, the mother/daughter team went back to New York City just as the city closed up.  They set up studios in their bedrooms: Lucy in Brooklyn, Suzzy in Manhattan, and finished the record.  Hailed as “one of the year’s best” by Americana Highways, the new album has been met with high praise. Suzzy and Lucy have recorded two albums previously, Fairytale \u0026 Myth (Independent Music Award winner) and Mud \u0026 Apples (also nominated for IMA).\n\nThose familiar with Lucy Wainwright Roche are aware of her bell tone voice, her unshakable melodies, and her knack for wise, wry lyrics. It’s no surprise that Wainwright Roche is the daughter of Suzzy Roche (The Roches) and Loudon Wainwright III, half sibling to Rufus and Martha Wainwright.  Lucy has carved out her own career as a touring singer/songwriter and recording artist, with five critically acclaimed solo recordings released on her own label: Eight Songs, Eight More, Lucy, There’s a Last Time for Everything and her most recent Little Beast (Winner of the Independent Music Award for Best Singer/Songwriter.)  Other recordings include a collaboration with her sister Martha Wainwright on Songs In the Dark, a collection of lullabies. For over a decade, as a solo act, armed with a guitar, a deadpan sense of humor, insightful songs, and a voice that makes tough guys cry, she’s built a solid following across the US and Europe.  As an opening act she has often appeared with such luminaries as The Indigo Girls, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Neko Case, and she’s one of a few who can step out alone in front of a thousand strangers and play an entire set to a rapt audience.\n\nSuzzy Roche is a singer/songwriter/performer/author and founding member of the singing group The Roches.  She has recorded over eighteen albums, written music for TV and Film, and toured extensively for forty years across the U.S. and Europe. She has performed with the experimental theater troupe, The Wooster Group, for over twenty years. Her children’s book Want To Be In A Band (Random House) was published in February 2013.  Wayward Saints (Hyperion/Voice) is her first novel and was a selection of the Spring 2012 B\u0026N Discover Great New Writers Program. Her most recent novel The Town Crazy was published in August of 2020.\nSuzzy Roche | Lucy Wainwright Roche\nPhoto: Shervin Lainez"},{"date":"2022-06-13T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2021/06/24082841/Bobby-McFerrin.jpg","title":"Bobby McFerrin\nCirclesongs\nHost: David Worm \u0026 Motion","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/10848/bobby-mcferrin-0613","details":"“You get people together and get them singing, and you instantly knock down all the  walls – the creeds, the gender, age and race differences, everything.

The music, however, doesn’t lodge inside the tight confines of the jazz idiom, which is not surprising considering the alto saxophonist and composer acknowledges the likes of Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye as significant touchstones. Similar to how Miles Davis’ seminal LP, On the Corner, subverted its main guiding lights – James Brown, Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone – then crafted its own unique, polyrhythmic, groove-laden, improv-heavy universe, Sounds from the Ancestors occupies its own space with intellectual clarity, sonic ingenuity and emotional heft.\n\n“The concept initially was about trying to get some of the musical sounds that I remembered as a kid growing up – sounds that lift your spirit from people like John Coltrane, ‘A Love Supreme’; Aretha Franklin, ‘Amazing Grace’; Marvin Gaye, ‘What’s Going On’; and the spiritual side of the church,” Garrett explains. “When I started to think about them, I realized it was the spirit from my ancestors.”\n\nIndeed, Sounds from the Ancestors reflects the rich jazz, R\u0026B, and gospel history of his hometown of Detroit. More important though, it also reverberates with a modern cosmopolitan vibrancy – notably the inclusion of music coming out of France, Cuba, Nigeria and Guadeloupe.\n\nWith his illustrious career that includes hallmark stints with Miles Davis, Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers, Donald Byrd, Freddie Hubbard, Woody Shaw and the Duke Ellington Orchestra, as well as a heralded career as a solo artist that began more than 30 years ago, Garrett is easily recognized as one of modern jazz’s brightest and most influential living masters. And with the marvelous Sounds from the Ancestors, the GRAMMY® Award-winning Garrett shows no signs of resting on his laurels. \n\nKenny Garret - Alto Sax and Soprano Sax\nVernell Brown - Acoustic Piano\nRudy Bird - Percussion\nCorcoran Holt - Acoustic Bass\nRonald Bruner Jr. - Drums\nMelvis Santa - Vocals; Keys\nWebsite | Facebook"},{"date":"2022-06-19T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2022/03/25085508/ChrisPierce-CREDIT.mathieu.bitton.jpg","title":"Chris Pierce","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/11374/chris-pierce","details":"CHRIS PIERCE gained national prominence with “We Can Always Come Back To This”.

DAVID HARDIMAN’S 83RD BIRTHDAY BASH!\nFeaturing the Music Arrangements/Compositions of Co-founder FRANK FISHER (Trumpeter-95 years old). Also, a Tribute to the Bands Vocalist DENISE PERRIER recently passing sung by the Great award-winning NINA CAUSEY and DAVID ANTHONY HARDIMAN.\n\nThe youngest of four children, David Hardiman was born in Indianappolis, IN, in 1939. “My parents were not middle class or well to do. My dad always worked an extra job and my mother worked very hard raising us.” David started playing trumpet and piano in the 4th grade. “I used the school trumpet until I could afford my own. My mother played the piano by ear, so growing up we had an upright in our house.”\n\nIn high school, David’s teachers recognized his talent and pushed him. David played in various concert bands, the marching band, and R.O.T.C. He was involved with a youth group, the Tempe Music Club, that his mother sponsored under the auspices of the Indianapolis Music Promoters, an organization that promoted African American youth. “The Music Promoters took me to New Orleans to play a classical concert. It was the first time I had ever been on a train. When I graduated, they gave me a $100 scholarship to go to Indiana University.”\n\nIndiana University didn’t offer jazz classes and the professors actively discouraged it. David remembers some musicians being threatened with expulsion by the Dean who called some of the musicians into his office over complaints that he and his friends were playing jazz in the East Hall. David says that whether he liked it or not, he had to graduate as a classical musician.\n\nDavid graduated in 1959 at the age of 20 and immediately started working as a substitute music teacher, until he landed a fulltime position. With his R.O.T.C. training, he says he could have gone into the army as a lieutenant, but his mother knew someone at the draft board so he wouldn’t have to serve. In 1960 he got married, and a couple years later his son, David Anthony Hardiman was born.\n\nFor the next ten years David played in several Big Bands in Indianapolis, and various other music ensembles, but his main focus was teaching.\n\nBy 1971, David was ready for a change. He knew that if he was going to make a name for himself, he had to leave Indianapolis and go to either New York or LA. He says the choice was easy—he hated the terrible East Coast weather! When he couldn’t find any teaching work in LA, he was encouraged by his mentors and friends, including Dr. Willis Kirk, to move to the Bay Area. They were able to get him a job at Berkeley’s Martin Luther King Jr. High School.\n\n“I was brought in as an affirmative action teacher and taught concert band and concert orchestra. I lived in Richmond and started going to jam sessions and began meeting people. There were only a few clubs in the East Bay, so I would go to an after-hours club in the Fillmore area in San Francisco. It wasn’t long before I started playing gigs.”\n\nWanting to move on from teaching Jr. High, David started teaching college at Contra Costa and Alameda in the East Bay and in 1974 followed Dr. Kirk to San Francisco City College. (Dr. Kirk became President of City College in the mid-80s. “I came in and took over the City College Big Band and a few years later established the Jazz Rock Improv Workshop for those who weren’t adept at reading. One of the good things about City College was the department would support my student concerts at the end of each semester. I was able to bring in some of the greatest jazz musicians in the world to perform with the school bands.”\n\nOnce David started teaching at City College of San Francisco, Dr. Willis Kirk began taking him to the International Association of Jazz Educators conferences. “They had a black caucus because the black musicians were not able to be a part of it in many situations, especially in the South. Jazz wasn’t taught in many schools at that time. Going to conferences, I met a lot of people from all over the country. I eventually directed the African American Jazz Caucus Big Band twice in Toronto, twice in New York, and once in Long Beach. When I retired in 2004 from teaching at City College of San Francisco after thirty years, my son, David Anthony Hardiman, also a trumpet player and teacher, took over my classes.”\n\nThe San Francisco All-Star Big Band\n\nDavid joined Local 6 in 1973 so he could play in the Golden Gate Park Band, which he did for 20 years. “I played in a few big bands when I got here, but I was like a token. They didn’t have very many black musicians performing with them.”\n\nIn 1975, big bands were going out of style, but David says he had something to prove. “I was trying to show everybody that black musicians could read and play and sound really good, because, with some of the black bands I played in, some of the musicians just really weren’t qualified.”\n\nWith a grant from the San Francisco Arts Commission, he established the San Francisco All-Star Big Band. “I called it that because we had musicians who played with Count Basie and Duke Ellington, and other legends. A lot of them have since passed on or moved away. We used to rehearse almost every Monday night. I was able to use the City College Band facilities, and Frank Fisher was writing for us. One memorable gig was we got to play behind Tony Bennett at the St. Francis Hotel. He sent me his charts and brought his piano conductor. That was big for my band.\"\n\nIn 1978, the SF All-Star Big Band made an LP and in 2003 David released it on CD. Today, the SF All-Star Big Band is still going strong. “We had our 37th anniversary at Yoshi’s with Denise Perrier, and Nina Causey singing. Recently we did an Ellington tribute at Yerba Buena Gardens in San Francisco, and the Sacramento Jazz Cooperative.”\nListen to the first CD of the Big Band at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFcH2zXBjM0 \nAlso, the 2nd CD of the Big Band at: https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kvBGvodGoslgKHPSjAXmjiHW6znxq6e6Y "},{"date":"2022-06-24T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2022/02/12104110/The-Blues-Broads.jpeg","title":"The Blues Broads","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/11219/the-blues-broads","details":"When four talented solo artists come together you might expect tension, but not so with the Blues Broads.

She founded her Patsy Cline Tribute band called ‘The Patsychords’ in 2010 and most recently created a variety cabaret show called 'Lady Margaret \u0026 The Countrypolitans' showcasing a variety of her favorite rare and classic crooner torch style jazz, country and blues songs, comedic sketches and storytelling. She has accomplished five rounds of her critically acclaimed portrayal of Patsy Cline in ‘Always... Patsy Cline’ twice at the Altarena Playhouse in Alameda CA, twice in New Orleans LA at the Stage Door Canteen, and once at The Woodminster Amphitheater in Oakland CA. She received a Theater Bay Area Award for being an outstanding performer in a musical for her portrayal of Patsy Cline and then in November of 2018 she took home another Theater Bay Area Award for her outstanding performance as a principal actor in 'Honky Tonk Angels'. A true renaissance woman, Margaret is a visual artist as well as a voice-over, on-camera and film actress. Her lead role in the film 'Hiding in Freedom' received an award from the World Music \u0026 Independent Film Festival for 'Best Lead Actress in a Short Film' as well as the film being accepted into the Cannes Film Festival. The authenticity and fearlessness with which Margaret approaches all of her creative endeavors make her a versatile and vivacious performer. She is so overjoyed and honored to be back at the Freight for her 8th annual Tribute to Patsy Cline with her stellar band of musical comrades.\n\nHer band features Freight favorite Maurice Tani on guitar, David Phillips on pedal steel, Mike Anderson on bass, Henry Salvia on piano, Ken Owen on drums, Jeanine Richardson on tambourine and Kathleen Salvia on harmonies. Maurice Tani has been a fixture on the local alt-country scene for more than a decade with his band 77 El Deora. The San Francisco Chronicle has praised his “twangy modern country sound” and called his songs “wry yet romantic, tender but aggressive.” Georgia native David Phillips has played guitar, dobro and steel guitar in Bay Area since the 1980’s building a reputation as an eclectic and adventurous musician with a profound love of all kinds of good music. David has worked with Tom Waits, Peter Rowan, Johnny Paycheck, Les Claypool, Metallica and Charlie Hunter In recent years he has been performing regularly in local theaters and with the Bay Area symphonies. Mike Anderson, how lucky is this guy? Not only has he been holding down the bass chair a part of Margret Belton’s tribute to Patsy Cline for nearly a decade, but he also records and tours with another member of Margaret’s band, Maurice Tani, and can be found around playing with a who's who of local singer-songwriters. Ken Owen is a Bay Area native, a professional musician that has shared the stage with such luminaries as Emmy Lou Harris, Peter Rowan, Buddy Miller, and Gillian Welch, and has written and self-published nine books of poetry and songs since 2010. Henry Salvia has had a long and varied career as a professional musician. He has performed before the crowned heads of Europe as well as Teddy Abrams' Swingin' City Lounge in Hamtramck, MI and the Wish-U-Well Lounge in Warren, MI. His piano stylings have been described by many as a cross between Cecil Taylor and Carmen Cavelllero, and have entranced more brides than you can shake a stick at. He is honored to be included in Margaret Belton's otherwise stellar lineup. Kathleen Enright Salvia began singing classic country music at The Redeye Saloon, a gay cowboy bar in the SF Tenderloin. She’s taken the long way around since then, tromping through genres from gospel to heavy metal with many stops between, and coming full circle to back up her friend Margaret. She also currently works with husband Henry in The Flying Salvias, known for their eclectic Ameri-kinda repertoire. “Tower of Power guitarist Jeff Tamalier calls Jeanine “J9” Richardson “The Motor”. Her trademark percussion and dancing behind, in front and across the stage for various Bay Area groups beginning with monster dance outfits Zasu Pitts Memorial Orchestra and Big Bang Beat, and more recently, Gayle Lynn \u0026 The Hired Hands, 77 El Deora and Valerie Jay \u0026 The Americanos, pushes the band and engages the audience. Remember, friends: You can't spell tambourine without the last three letters of Jeanine!”\n\nCatch this tribute to one of the greatest country singers of all time, performed by a group of terrific musicians imbued with the spirit of Patsy Cline!\n\n“Margaret Belton. Chanteuse extraordinaire and a radiant soul with a smile that lights up the stage and makes us all feel alright.

Country music has been made by and loved by Black people since its conception. For just as long, we have been overlooked and disregarded in the genre by fans and executives. Black Opry wants to change that. We invite you to discover, support and enjoy Black artists with us. One of the most valuable aspects of country music is its versatility and diversity in sound. Country, blues, folk, and Americana music often overlap or weave together- our artists explore all of those sounds and intersections.\nWebsite | Instagram\nRissi Palmer's gift lies in reaching across all musical boundaries. While she made her mark in Country Music, she is equally at home in R\u0026B music, bringing the entire spectrum of popular music to bear on music she calls “Southern Soul.”\nThe daughter of Georgia natives, Rissi was born near Pittsburgh, PA and spent her adolescent years in St. Louis, Missouri. Raised in a musical family that loved both country and R\u0026B, Rissi was a part of a singing and dancing troupe sponsored by a local television station at age 16, and by the time she was 19 years old, she had already been offered her first publishing and label deal.  \nIn 2007, she released her debut album Rissi Palmer, charting singles, “Country Girl,” “Hold On To Me,” and “No Air.” Since then, Rissi has independently released a Christmas single, her first children’s album, Best Day Ever and an EP titled The Back Porch Sessions. Her most recent album, Revival, was released in 2019 and has been critically hailed as her most personal and uplifting work to date.\nAs a passionate voice for country artists of color and those who have been marginalized in mainstream country music, Rissi launched her own radio show Color Me Country with Rissi Palmer on Apple Music Country. Since making its debut in August 2020, listeners have been treated to in-depth and riveting, often funny, yet very necessary conversations with artists such as Brittney Spencer, Chapel Hart, Crystal Shawanda, Darius Rucker, Mickey Guyton, Miko Marks, The War and Treaty and many more. In conjunction with her radio show, Rissi also created the Color Me Country Artist Grant Fund designed to support new country artists of color who are just beginning to build their music careers.  \n\nWebsite | Facebook\n  While Miko Marks is no newcomer, Our Country (via Redtone Records), is her first album in 13 years so her name may be fresh to the uninformed.  In 2003, Marks made her way to Music City - Nashville, TN - Playing CMA fest year after year and fully immersing herself in the country music community.  While Marks received well-deserved accolades - \"Nashville's Hottest New Country Star\" by People Magazine and \"Best New Country Artist\" by New Music Weekly - Her efforts to be fully embraced by the industry in return proved to be elusive.  While her crowd of supporters grew year after year, so did efforts from the industry to diminish her success.  \"In trying to pursue the gates of Nashville, I discuvered that there were high fences made of stone,\" Marks said of her experiece in the early 2000s. She recalls \"rules\" for being able to play the largest CMA fest showcases, those of which contained criteria nearly impossible to achieve for independent artists lik herself.  This experience ultimately led her to pick up her life and move to California to start anew, never giving up on the dream she was devoted to.\nMiko Marks proves to be a bonifide maverick that has blazed an unprecedented trail in the music industry.  After a long overdue hiatus from music, Marks is eager to spread not only her music, but a message of unity and outspokenness for Black musicians in country music and beyond.  She has done much more than just make a splash and now she is ready to make waves.  Marks works towards an ever evolving dream of creating art that is not stereotyped or pigeonholed by a specific genre and is created with no borders or boundaries.\nOur Country released in March 2021 and garnered praise from NPR, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Billboard, among others.  Marks continues to release music via Redtone Records with an EP release, Race Records, out this fall and a US tour to support.\nWebsite | Facebook\n  Connecting people through storytelling is what motivates Stephanie Jacques every day as a songwriter. At the age of eight she began vocal training in opera and later rounded out her skill set with musical theater. She had a non-traditional upbringing, being raised alongside adopted siblings by her grandmother after her own mother died at 26. Her ability to storytell, in large measure, comes from the hardships she experienced during these younger years.\nCareer aspirations as a songwriter began when she moved to LA to get her degree in music business from CSU Northridge. She found the musical community vibrant and rich opportunities to perform and collaborate with peers. Stephanie especially enjoyed her time as a street busker on Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade. “I received immediate feedback on my music which was priceless. This was a time of many lessons learned and even more lessons applied!” In addition, she fused her love of sports with music by singing regularly for the Golden State Warriors, the Oakland Athletics and Raiders, and the Los Angeles Clippers and Lakers. \nToday, Stephanie volunteers with Musicians on Call where she brings music to Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt. She has been a member of the Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI) since 2015 and is a  member of the Recording Academy. In addition, she has performed as a supporting singer on the Grammys’ stage. She moved to Nashville to devote herself full-time to songwriting. She feels blessed every day that she can collaborate on new releases with multiple young artists. \nWebsite | Facebook | Instagram\n  Some write music as a creative release. Others feel compelled to perform. For country-soul singer-songwriter Leon Timbo, music is used as a form of growth and healing. Timbo has long regarded music as an indispensable aspect of his life for as long as he can remember. Growing up the son of two pastors in Jacksonville, FL, music was integrated into his life from the very start, as a way to communicate spiritual experience. Along with his parents, his grandmother Virginia was one of the first to introduce him to music by singing Ray Charles styled songs to him as a kid and later buying him his first guitar at the age of 17. From there, his musical aspirations took flight.\nAt sixteen, Timbo began singing and by age twenty, he began playing the guitar and performing in a serious way, inspired by artists Bill Withers, James Taylor and Tim Miner. By 2005, after cutting his independently released album Soul Sessions, Timbo was successfully touring across the U.S. on an almost non-stop small venue circuit, building a loyal fanbase from coast to coast. Today, Timbo is gearing up to release his EP, Lovers and Fools, with themes of love, loss and letting go. “My upcoming album came from my hardest relationship process, and it came about as a result of handling my grief,” Timbo says of the record. “I recorded this album in Chicago, LA, and Nashville. This musical experience was like a coming of age. This album gave me the freedom to authentically be me,” he continues.\nTimbo’s country roots sound incorporates equal measures of vintage soul, gospel, folk, R\u0026B and even modern blues making for a unique experience that some have described as \"transparent soul.\" From grieving the loss of a great love in the album title track “Lovers and Fools” to touching on the heavy topic of being a Black man in today’s political climate in “Loves Not Supposed to Hurt,” and the whimsical take on the fact that life can be lonely as seen in “With A Kiss,” Timbo holds nothing back in his delivery of Lovers and Fools. The 8-track EP will be released in the fall of 2021 on eOne with support from Brooklyn Basement Records.\nWebsite | Facebook"},{"date":"2022-07-01T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2022/03/31070940/BillKirchen.jpg","title":"Bill Kirchen","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/11409/bill-kirchen","details":"Upon tallying how many decades he’s worked as a professional guitar slinger, Telecaster master Bill Kirchen quips, “Well, they don't make 50 years like they used to.” They don’t often make careers like his, either.\n\nFrom performing with his Who Knows Pickers jug band in Ann Arbor High School’s senior talent show (also on the program: the future Iggy Pop), to birthing the Americana genre with the original “hippie country band,” Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen, this affable Austinite has been everywhere, man, flying alongside some of the planet’s coolest cats — including the Jesus of Cool, Nick Lowe, and Lowe’s old protégé, Elvis Costello.\n\nBut whatever label Kirchen’s music wears, it’s always notable for its balance of high-octane energy and deft understatement.

Produced by the musical’s arranger Sergio Mendoza, the album features his band Orkesta Mendoza, Carrie on vocals and strings, and guest vocalists Joey Burns (Calexico), Brian Lopez, and Carlos Arzate.\nWebsite | Facebook"},{"date":"2022-06-27T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2021/06/24082841/Bobby-McFerrin.jpg","title":"Bobby McFerrin\nCirclesongs\nHost: David Worm \u0026 Motion","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/10848/bobby-mcferrin-0627","details":"“You get people together and get them singing, and you instantly knock down all the  walls – the creeds, the gender, age and race differences, everything.

Country music has been made by and loved by Black people since its conception. For just as long, we have been overlooked and disregarded in the genre by fans and executives. Black Opry wants to change that. We invite you to discover, support and enjoy Black artists with us. One of the most valuable aspects of country music is its versatility and diversity in sound. Country, blues, folk, and Americana music often overlap or weave together- our artists explore all of those sounds and intersections.\nWebsite | Instagram\nRissi Palmer's gift lies in reaching across all musical boundaries. While she made her mark in Country Music, she is equally at home in R\u0026B music, bringing the entire spectrum of popular music to bear on music she calls “Southern Soul.”\nThe daughter of Georgia natives, Rissi was born near Pittsburgh, PA and spent her adolescent years in St. Louis, Missouri. Raised in a musical family that loved both country and R\u0026B, Rissi was a part of a singing and dancing troupe sponsored by a local television station at age 16, and by the time she was 19 years old, she had already been offered her first publishing and label deal.  \nIn 2007, she released her debut album Rissi Palmer, charting singles, “Country Girl,” “Hold On To Me,” and “No Air.” Since then, Rissi has independently released a Christmas single, her first children’s album, Best Day Ever and an EP titled The Back Porch Sessions. Her most recent album, Revival, was released in 2019 and has been critically hailed as her most personal and uplifting work to date.\nAs a passionate voice for country artists of color and those who have been marginalized in mainstream country music, Rissi launched her own radio show Color Me Country with Rissi Palmer on Apple Music Country. Since making its debut in August 2020, listeners have been treated to in-depth and riveting, often funny, yet very necessary conversations with artists such as Brittney Spencer, Chapel Hart, Crystal Shawanda, Darius Rucker, Mickey Guyton, Miko Marks, The War and Treaty and many more. In conjunction with her radio show, Rissi also created the Color Me Country Artist Grant Fund designed to support new country artists of color who are just beginning to build their music careers.  \n\nWebsite | Facebook\n  While Miko Marks is no newcomer, Our Country (via Redtone Records), is her first album in 13 years so her name may be fresh to the uninformed.  In 2003, Marks made her way to Music City - Nashville, TN - Playing CMA fest year after year and fully immersing herself in the country music community.  While Marks received well-deserved accolades - \"Nashville's Hottest New Country Star\" by People Magazine and \"Best New Country Artist\" by New Music Weekly - Her efforts to be fully embraced by the industry in return proved to be elusive.  While her crowd of supporters grew year after year, so did efforts from the industry to diminish her success.  \"In trying to pursue the gates of Nashville, I discuvered that there were high fences made of stone,\" Marks said of her experiece in the early 2000s. She recalls \"rules\" for being able to play the largest CMA fest showcases, those of which contained criteria nearly impossible to achieve for independent artists lik herself.  This experience ultimately led her to pick up her life and move to California to start anew, never giving up on the dream she was devoted to.\nMiko Marks proves to be a bonifide maverick that has blazed an unprecedented trail in the music industry.  After a long overdue hiatus from music, Marks is eager to spread not only her music, but a message of unity and outspokenness for Black musicians in country music and beyond.  She has done much more than just make a splash and now she is ready to make waves.  Marks works towards an ever evolving dream of creating art that is not stereotyped or pigeonholed by a specific genre and is created with no borders or boundaries.\nOur Country released in March 2021 and garnered praise from NPR, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Billboard, among others.  Marks continues to release music via Redtone Records with an EP release, Race Records, out this fall and a US tour to support.\nWebsite | Facebook\n  Connecting people through storytelling is what motivates Stephanie Jacques every day as a songwriter. At the age of eight she began vocal training in opera and later rounded out her skill set with musical theater. She had a non-traditional upbringing, being raised alongside adopted siblings by her grandmother after her own mother died at 26. Her ability to storytell, in large measure, comes from the hardships she experienced during these younger years.\nCareer aspirations as a songwriter began when she moved to LA to get her degree in music business from CSU Northridge. She found the musical community vibrant and rich opportunities to perform and collaborate with peers. Stephanie especially enjoyed her time as a street busker on Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade. “I received immediate feedback on my music which was priceless. This was a time of many lessons learned and even more lessons applied!” In addition, she fused her love of sports with music by singing regularly for the Golden State Warriors, the Oakland Athletics and Raiders, and the Los Angeles Clippers and Lakers. \nToday, Stephanie volunteers with Musicians on Call where she brings music to Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt. She has been a member of the Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI) since 2015 and is a  member of the Recording Academy. In addition, she has performed as a supporting singer on the Grammys’ stage. She moved to Nashville to devote herself full-time to songwriting. She feels blessed every day that she can collaborate on new releases with multiple young artists. \nWebsite | Facebook | Instagram\n  Some write music as a creative release. Others feel compelled to perform. For country-soul singer-songwriter Leon Timbo, music is used as a form of growth and healing. Timbo has long regarded music as an indispensable aspect of his life for as long as he can remember. Growing up the son of two pastors in Jacksonville, FL, music was integrated into his life from the very start, as a way to communicate spiritual experience. Along with his parents, his grandmother Virginia was one of the first to introduce him to music by singing Ray Charles styled songs to him as a kid and later buying him his first guitar at the age of 17. From there, his musical aspirations took flight.\nAt sixteen, Timbo began singing and by age twenty, he began playing the guitar and performing in a serious way, inspired by artists Bill Withers, James Taylor and Tim Miner. By 2005, after cutting his independently released album Soul Sessions, Timbo was successfully touring across the U.S. on an almost non-stop small venue circuit, building a loyal fanbase from coast to coast. Today, Timbo is gearing up to release his EP, Lovers and Fools, with themes of love, loss and letting go. “My upcoming album came from my hardest relationship process, and it came about as a result of handling my grief,” Timbo says of the record. “I recorded this album in Chicago, LA, and Nashville. This musical experience was like a coming of age. This album gave me the freedom to authentically be me,” he continues.\nTimbo’s country roots sound incorporates equal measures of vintage soul, gospel, folk, R\u0026B and even modern blues making for a unique experience that some have described as \"transparent soul.\" From grieving the loss of a great love in the album title track “Lovers and Fools” to touching on the heavy topic of being a Black man in today’s political climate in “Loves Not Supposed to Hurt,” and the whimsical take on the fact that life can be lonely as seen in “With A Kiss,” Timbo holds nothing back in his delivery of Lovers and Fools. The 8-track EP will be released in the fall of 2021 on eOne with support from Brooklyn Basement Records.\nWebsite | Facebook"},{"date":"2022-07-01T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2022/03/31070940/BillKirchen.jpg","title":"Bill Kirchen","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/11409/bill-kirchen","details":"Upon tallying how many decades he’s worked as a professional guitar slinger, Telecaster master Bill Kirchen quips, “Well, they don't make 50 years like they used to.” They don’t often make careers like his, either.\n\nFrom performing with his Who Knows Pickers jug band in Ann Arbor High School’s senior talent show (also on the program: the future Iggy Pop), to birthing the Americana genre with the original “hippie country band,” Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen, this affable Austinite has been everywhere, man, flying alongside some of the planet’s coolest cats — including the Jesus of Cool, Nick Lowe, and Lowe’s old protégé, Elvis Costello.\n\nBut whatever label Kirchen’s music wears, it’s always notable for its balance of high-octane energy and deft understatement. There’s no leadfoot excess; Kirchen’s all about finesse — a sensibility absorbed from the symphonies and Broadway musicals his parents loved, along with the orchestral works he played as a school-band trombonist. Through another major influence, Interlochen Center for the Arts summer camp counselor David Siglin (who would go on to run famed Ann Arbor venue the Ark), Kirchen became immersed in folk traditions and learned to love the “big, sonorous tones” of an undistorted guitar.  “I was more interested in sounding like Doc Watson than Eric Clapton,” admits Kirchen, whose main guitar was crafted by Rick Kelly of Carmine Street Guitars from 200-year-old pine floorboards recycled from film director Jim Jarmusch’s loft.\n\nWebsite | Facebook\n "},{"date":"2022-07-02T00:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://cdn.thefreight.org/assets/2022/03/16112147/Mario-y-su-Timbeko.jpg","title":"Mario y su Timbeko","url":"https://secure.thefreight.org/11359/mario-y-su-timbeko","details":"DANCE FLOOR OPEN\nA Cuban Salsa Dance Class will be taught by Ryan and Sidney of Rueda Con Ritmo before the show from 7:10 to 7:45pm.

The first New York Moth event was held in George’s living room and the story events quickly spread to larger venues throughout the city.\nThrough ongoing programs in more than 29 cities, The Moth has presented over 30,000 stories to standing-room-only crowds worldwide and it currently produces more than 500 live shows each year.
