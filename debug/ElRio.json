In that spirit, we thought it would be cool to show some films that represent local Bay Area cinematographers and surfers.\nGrab your tickets in advance for $20 or $25 at the door.\nBesides production costs, all proceeds will go to the City Surf Project\nSchedule for the evening:\n7 - 8:30 pm - Socializing, City Surf Project team meet/greet \u0026 live surf-inspired music in El Rio's courtyard\n8:30 - 9:45 pm - Screening of all short films\n9:45 - 10 pm - Closing remarks and CSP Surf-a-thon announcement\nAbout the City Surf Project\nCity Surf Project works to ensure equitable access to the coastline and surfing, for youth that has been historically marginalized by the sport. CSP works with schools and organizations in the Bay Area to offer year-long surf programming, where students gain life skills while connecting with the environment.\nThis year, CSP is hosting its fifth annual Surf-a-thon on June 18th to celebrate International Surfing Day. Participants are encouraged to raise funds for CSP‚Äôs subsidized summer surf programs. This summer CSP will go on over 50 surf outings and introduce over 100 youth to the ocean. The fundraising campaign will kick off on May 18th with a Surf Short Film Event at EL Rio. From there, folks will have a month to raise funds and fulfill their pledge at the Surf-a-thon on June 18th at Ocean Beach. Come join us so that we can share the stoke with as many youths as possible this summer."},{"date":"2022-05-20T21:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d3flpus5evl89n.cloudfront.net/5ecdc94bdf82fe44f68247b5/6282c406d6f36b7243d4b249/scaled_768.jpg","title":"HOME BASE - Farewell Party :(","url":"https://tockify.com/elriosf2/detail/1323/1653105600000","details":""},{"date":"2022-05-21T21:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d3flpus5evl89n.cloudfront.net/5ecdc94bdf82fe44f68247b5/62606ebd4cfe6740cccee313/scaled_768.jpg","title":"FUNERAL CHANT ++ MOLTEN ++ PHATASMAL ABYSS ($12 ADV / $15 DOOR)","url":"https://tockify.com/elriosf2/detail/1300/1653192000000","details":"rws and subliminalsf present\nSATURDAY MAY 21ST\n----\nFUNERAL CHANT\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FuneralChantUS\nMOLTEN\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Molten666/\nPHATASMAL ABYSS\nhttps://www.facebook.com/phantasmalabyss\n----\nDoors 9:00pm / Show 9:30pm\n$12 Advance / $15 Door\n----\nEL RIO\n3158 Mission Street, SF ‚Ä¢ 21+\nAdv Tickets: https://rwspresents.com/tickets/052122"},{"date":"2022-05-22T15:00:00.000+00:00","img":"https://d3flpus5evl89n.cloudfront.net/5ecdc94bdf82fe44f68247b5/624e08290647430a04491ff8/scaled_768.jpg","title":"SALSA SUNDAYS!!!
