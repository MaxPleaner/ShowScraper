Founded and fronted of course by singer/ guitarist Gordon Gano and acoustic bass guitarist Brian Ritchie, the Milwaukee-born combo remains as warm, wise and weird as ever before, with such new favorites as “Another Chorus” and “Everlasting You” continuing to mine the vast range of ideas, melodic complexity and organic sonic craftsmanship that has characterized the band’s body of work since their landmark self-titled 1983 debut.\n\n“I think it’s probably the best [album] we’ve made since HALLOWED GROUND,” Ritchie says. “We didn’t really know that we had something to say, but it turns out that the songs are really good and we were able to sink our teeth into them and come up with something which is just as good as anything we’ve ever done. I’m even a little bit surprised myself.”\nViolent Femmes are undeniably one of the most inventive and original bands of this or any other era, constantly pushing forward with their singular blend of folk and punk, sarcasm and spirituality. Founded in 1981, the originally Milwaukee-based band’s remarkable three-decade-plus career has produced a series of truly iconic singles – among them such classics as “American Music,” “Gone Daddy Gone,” “Nightmares,” “Add It Up” and of course, “Blister In The Sun” – along with cumulative worldwide album sales in excess of 10 million, with 1983’s VIOLENT FEMMES awarded RIAA platinum eight years after its initial release."},{"date":"2022-06-08T00:00:00.000+00:00","url":"https://theuctheatre.org/events/buy-tickets/yann-tiersen/detail","title":"Yann Tiersen - Live A/N Tour 2022","img":"https://theuctheatre.org/userfiles/events/images/397/yann-tiersen.jpeg?20220530222828","details":"KALW Presents\n\nGuillaume Yann Tiersen (born June 23, 1970 in Brittany, France) is a French musician who is best known for being the composer of the soundtrack for the popular 2001 movie \"Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain\".

The resulting work is part love story, part historical excavation, an extraordinary and exhilarating ode to the power of family and the enduring resilience of our shared humanity. The collection is bold and thought provoking, grappling with racism, capitalism, and the very meaning of freedom itself, all without ever losing sight of the desire and determination at the heart of the tale. The performances, meanwhile, are similarly ambitious and emotionally charged, mixing blistering rock and roll grit with infectious R\u0026B grooves and buoyant funk energy to deliver a sound that manages to feel both vintage and experimental all at once. The experience challenges our notions of who we are, where we come from, and, perhaps most importantly, where we’re headed.
