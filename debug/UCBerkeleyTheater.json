Founded and fronted of course by singer/ guitarist Gordon Gano and acoustic bass guitarist Brian Ritchie, the Milwaukee-born combo remains as warm, wise and weird as ever before, with such new favorites as “Another Chorus” and “Everlasting You” continuing to mine the vast range of ideas, melodic complexity and organic sonic craftsmanship that has characterized the band’s body of work since their landmark self-titled 1983 debut.\n\n“I think it’s probably the best [album] we’ve made since HALLOWED GROUND,” Ritchie says. “We didn’t really know that we had something to say, but it turns out that the songs are really good and we were able to sink our teeth into them and come up with something which is just as good as anything we’ve ever done. I’m even a little bit surprised myself.”\nViolent Femmes are undeniably one of the most inventive and original bands of this or any other era, constantly pushing forward with their singular blend of folk and punk, sarcasm and spirituality. Founded in 1981, the originally Milwaukee-based band’s remarkable three-decade-plus career has produced a series of truly iconic singles – among them such classics as “American Music,” “Gone Daddy Gone,” “Nightmares,” “Add It Up” and of course, “Blister In The Sun” – along with cumulative worldwide album sales in excess of 10 million, with 1983’s VIOLENT FEMMES awarded RIAA platinum eight years after its initial release."},{"date":"2022-06-08T00:00:00.000+00:00","url":"https://theuctheatre.org/events/buy-tickets/yann-tiersen/detail","title":"Yann Tiersen - Live A/N Tour 2022","img":"https://theuctheatre.org/userfiles/events/images/397/yann-tiersen.jpeg?20220531230246","details":"KALW Presents\n\nGuillaume Yann Tiersen (born June 23, 1970 in Brittany, France) is a French musician who is best known for being the composer of the soundtrack for the popular 2001 movie \"Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain\".

The resulting work is part love story, part historical excavation, an extraordinary and exhilarating ode to the power of family and the enduring resilience of our shared humanity. The collection is bold and thought provoking, grappling with racism, capitalism, and the very meaning of freedom itself, all without ever losing sight of the desire and determination at the heart of the tale. The performances, meanwhile, are similarly ambitious and emotionally charged, mixing blistering rock and roll grit with infectious R\u0026B grooves and buoyant funk energy to deliver a sound that manages to feel both vintage and experimental all at once. The experience challenges our notions of who we are, where we come from, and, perhaps most importantly, where we’re headed.

Yet, under that shiny veneer lays a dark heart, beating with sharp wit and cynical alienation, and the music is all the more alluring for it. TV Girl, comprised of Brad Petering, Jason Wyman, and Wyatt Harmon, was formed in 2010 by Petering as an outlet to blend the love of Spector-esque girl-group pop with an emerging interest in hip-hop. Featuring shimmering vocals and sampled beats, the self-titled debut EP of the same year turned heads online immediately; the group’s lush vintage rhythms and timeless pop hooks were even making waves on the BBC. They continued to release increasingly popular EPs and mixtapes between tours.\n\nTV Girl’s latest album, Death Of A Party Girl, sustains the dream pop, neo-psychedelic feel of previous work. Petering delivers prosaic storytelling in third-person narration, recounting tales of wistful, romantic flings and mini-dramas starring various shades of the archetypal manic pixie dream girl. The songs are echoing and surreal, cut with samples of dialogue from movies and radio shows that convey a grainy, vintage feel. Standouts include “King of Echo Park,” its beachy vibe conjuring images of skinny palm trees, graffitied skateparks, and humming lowriders; \"7 Days Til Sunday\", a swaying, upbeat bop where the narrator reminisces of rooftop parties and one night stands in Manhattan; and the intoxicating \"Every Stupid Actress\"."},{"date":"2022-08-19T00:00:00.000+00:00","url":"https://theuctheatre.org/events/buy-tickets/at-the-gates/detail","title":"At The Gates","img":"https://theuctheatre.org/userfiles/events/images/511/at-the-gates.jpeg?20220531230253","details":"At The Gates performing \"SLAUGHTER OF THE SOUL\" in its entirety!\n\nLimited Seating Available - Standing Room Only \n\nWith Municipal Waste, Thrown Into Exile"},{"date":"2022-08-20T00:00:00.000+00:00","url":"https://theuctheatre.org/events/buy-tickets/carpenter-brut/detail","title":"Carpenter Brut","img":"https://theuctheatre.org/userfiles/events/images/499/carpenter-brut.jpeg?20220531230253","details":"Standing room - limited seats available. \n\nFour years after the 130 shows across the northern hemisphere with the Leather Patrol Tour, Carpenter Brut will hit the road again in 2022 with the second part of his second trilogy: the Leather Terror Tour. \nThe story, entirely written and composed by Carpenter Brut, takes a new turn.

From sweaty club shows to uproarious festival dates to opening up for America’s most beloved rock acts, these five lifers’ deeds are best measured in the smiles they’ve slapped on the faces of true believers and new listeners, alike.Silver Linings is the name of the new Less Than Jake album, their first full- length for the Pure Noise label and the follow-up to 2013’s See The Light. It also doubles as a bunch of sonic diary pages and a mission statement that cements their conviction after two decades in this rock ‘n’ roll circus. Indeed, LTJ—frontman/guitarist Chris DeMakes, bassist/vocalist Roger Lima, trombonist Buddy Schaub, saxophonist Peter “JR” Wasilewski and new drummer Matt Yonker—have escaped most (but not all) forms of ennui, depression and violence against screen-based objects to create an endorsement of humanity."},{"date":"2022-09-19T00:00:00.000+00:00","url":"https://theuctheatre.org/events/just-announced/tinariwen-2/detail","title":"Tinariwen","img":"https://theuctheatre.org/userfiles/events/images/523/tinariwen-2.jpeg?20220531230256","details":"Standing Room Only - Limited Seating Available"},{"date":"2022-10-08T00:00:00.000+00:00","url":"https://theuctheatre.org/events/buy-tickets/mom-jeans/detail","title":"Mom Jeans","img":"https://theuctheatre.org/userfiles/events/images/521/mom-jeans.jpeg?20220531230257","details":"Standing room - limited seats available.\n\nwith special guests Free Throw, Just Friends, and Small Crush\n\n“Give me something sweet so I can make it through the week/Don’t care if I end up with cavities.”\n\nThis is the plea that opens Sweet Tooth, the upcoming third LP from Berkeley’s Mom Jeans. It’s the introduction to a quasi-concept record, a structural departure for the emo punk quartet. Before any of the record’s 13 songs had been written and recorded, the band knew what Sweet Tooth would sound like: late ‘90s and early 2000s pop rock and pop punk bliss. For frontman Eric Butler, that meant revisiting the guitar pop perfection of Weezer and Oasis alongside deep cuts from one-hit wonders like Third Eye Blind, Fountains of Wayne, and Superdrag.\nButler, guitarist Bart Thompson, bassist Samuel Kless, and drummer Austin Carango all arrived at the same description for these sounds: ear candy.\n\n“Those hits by Blink-182 and Green Day, all those bands, it’s just hooks for days and really excellent songwriting,” says Butler. “They really just tried to write incredible songs that would get stuck in people’s heads. We wanted to try our own version of that. Ear candy is the goal, so Sweet Tooth is the record.”"},{"date":"2023-06-11T00:00:00.000+00:00","url":"https://theuctheatre.org/events/buy-tickets/eels-lockdown-hurricane-tour/detail","title":"EELS - Lockdown Hurricane Tour","img":"https://theuctheatre.org/userfiles/events/images/426/eels-lockdown-hurricane-tour.jpeg?20220531230257","details":""}]
