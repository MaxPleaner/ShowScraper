# ShowScraper

This is a collection of a bunch of scrapers which fetch concert listings from
various venues in the Bay Area.

It also is a website to view the listings.

## Tech Stack

The scraper uses headless [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
([Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads))
and is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

Results are converted to [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
and pushed to a [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
bucket.

The front end is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/)
and styled with [Bulma CSS framework](https://bulma.io/).
