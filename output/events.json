You’re all one at  that point, lifting your voices.” – Bobby McFerrin\nIf you love to sing, you are welcome to join Circlesongs with Bobby McFerrin, hosted by David Worm & Motion, for a singing session full of joy-filled improvised music-making for  singers of all levels of experience. Every Monday at noon for ninety minute at the wonderful Freight  & Salvage in Berkeley.\nBobby first developed Circlesongs in his now legendary solo a cappella performances, when he needed  other voices to help manifest his musical ideas. He gave the audience parts to sing, layering harmonies  and rhythms, using call and response, conducting and composing his spontaneous inventions. During  his years of worldwide touring, he evolved a variety of vocal groups beginning in the ‘80’s with his Bay  Area based group Voicestra. \nBobby’s Circlesongs concerts celebrated all the kinds of music that would spontaneously emerge from  anywhere in his stream-of-consciousness, like maybe from Americana or classical, R&B, gospel, folk,  pop, rock, beatboxing—combined with any sound he could imagine. For Bobby, Circlesongs is not a concert or a performance… it is a service to create a singing space that is without words, genres or pre existing knowledge. There is a place in the circle for everyone. \nThese sessions will be hosted by David Worm, an original member of both Bobby’s Voicestra and  Gimme5, and a diversely gifted team of celebrated Bay Area singers. Including Bryan Dyer, Destani  Wolf, Tammi Brown and others. Bobby has recently moved back to San Francisco from Philadelphia  and is really excited to begin to create with these wonderful singers. \n“Bobby McFerrin’s greatest gift to his audience may be changing them from spectators  into celebrants and transforming a concert hall into a playground, a village center, a  joyous space.” – Los Angeles Times \nBobby McFerrin is an inspiration to singers around the world who celebrate his innovative technique  and spirit. His solo performances and collaborations with great artists—including Yo-Yo Ma, Chick  Corea, and the Vienna Philharmonic—are the stuff of legend. Along the way, there were 10 Grammy  Awards and a #1 global hit “Don’t Worry, Be Happy.” bobbymcferrin.com \n“Bobby McFerrin is an artist whose blinding originality has set him on a course that has  no maps but is awash with possibilities lurking in every curve of the road… sheer joy in  the elemental beauty of the voice… celebrates music as a primal essence, as crucial to  our sense of ourselves as breathing” – The Irish Times"

            "details": "Doors 6pm // Show 7pm // All Ages // $18 Advance & $21 Day of Show\nCornerstone Presents:\nPRINCE DADDY & THE HYENA\nIt’s a very natural human phenomenon to be scared of death. Whether it’s the idea of your own impending doom that’s rattling around your skull or the mortality of those close to you, such thoughts are part of the curse of human consciousness. Yet for Kory Gregory, that fear was extreme. So extreme, in fact, that when Prince Daddy & The Hyena were in the middle of making this third full-length, the vocalist/guitarist of the Albany, NY band had to take some time out from, well, everything.\n“I was really scared of dying for some reason,” he remembers. “I know being scared of dying isn’t irrational, but I had an irrational fear of it to a non-functional point. I actually  went to a psychiatric hospital for a month in the middle of writing this record because of it.”\n“You were afraid of it beforehand,” chimes in guitarist Cameron Handford, “and then we actually almost died. We were driving home from a tour and we just wanted to get home really bad. We’d driven through blizzards a million times before being from New York, so we just kept going and that was not the right idea – it was a 12-hour drive and everyone was really tired. One thing led to another and we slid off the road into a snow plough. The van looked like none of us should have survived it. It was pretty intense.”\nThat incident occurred in November 2018, right before the band – now completed by drummer Daniel Gorham and bassist Adam Dasilva – recorded their second album, 2019’s Cosmic Thrill Seekers. They’d already written that record, though, and besides, Gregory’s fixation with death hadn’t quite reached such debilitating proportions by that point. But little by little, it got worse and worse until it was overbearing and all-consuming. Unsurprisingly, then, the 13 songs that make up this self-titled third full-length are riddled with ruminations on life coming to an end.\n“It’s all about my fear of death,” explains Gregory, “but not just for myself. It’s my fear of me dying, my parents dying, my loved ones dying, my fear of aging. My fear of mortality in the most loose, broad sense of the word. It’s the first time that it’s hit me as an adult, the first time that the impermanence of everything struck, and that sent me into a little existential spiral.”\nTo some extent, then, you could call this a kind of concept album, but it’s an accidental one – less intentional than a by-product of the morbid thoughts Gregory was having at the time manifesting themselves into songs by way of catharsis. But that, he clarifies, is just what always happens anyway when he writes.\n“I feel like any record I write is going to be a kind of concept record,” he says, “because I have an obsessive mind and get caught up in something and just write. So everything I wrote in quarantine was about the same thing, about my fear of dying. It’s a snapshot of what I was going through when I wrote these songs.”\nThat said, there are some traditional concept record trademarks present on the album, including a recurring character called The Collector who crops up in different places throughout it. The Collector, says Gregory, is really just “depression or death in corporeal form”, the unimaginable fate that awaits us all personified. Ideally, Gregory wants the listener to imagine The Collector as the photo of his cousin that graces the cover album artwork.\n“To me,” he says, “that photo is the essence of the record. When people hear me singing about the character on this record that isn’t me, I want them to picture that, because it’s a really fucking frightening image!”\nWhether Gregory is relaying his fears more vicariously and allegorically though The Collector or in a more direct fashion, Prince Daddy & The Hyena delves deep into the heart of darkness at its core. In fact, penultimate song, “Black Mold” is a brooding, near-nine minute long lament in which the frontman revisits one of the bleakest times in his entire life to date. A song that chugs with the anguish of existence, it begins with a voicemail before slowly building into a layered, emotional slow-motion frenzy of redemptive guitars.\n“I had a stint with depression that almost cost me my life,” explains Gregory, “and this song is the first time I ever wrote about it. It’s my favorite song that I’ve ever written, because I haven’t really thought about what happened or ever written about it since, but the end result is something that I’m super proud of.”\n“And as for the voicemail,” adds Dasilva, “it was left by a friend of Kory’s who called Kory one night. Kory missed the phone call and then listened to the voicemail and was very worried because he sounded like he was drunker than ever before, and also borderline suicidal. Kory hadn’t talked to him for over a decade, but the whole night Kory is trying to call him back, freaking out that he missed his call, because he even called Kory’s mom, too. It definitely seemed serious. Eventually, Kory goes to bed and the next morning his friend texted him back and was like ‘Oh man, I’m sorry. I was so drunk last night!’”\n“It was just like a funny blackout drunk thing,” says Gregory, “and I was like ‘Damn, dude. I thought you were fucking dead!’” \nThat blur between and juxtaposition of darkness and levity is something Prince Daddy & The Hyena have always done well, and the four-piece utilize that technique to maximum effect on this album. Recorded, like Cosmic Thrill Seekers, by Nick “Scoops” Dardaris – this time at the Barber Shop Studios in New Jersey – it constantly grapples lyrically with difficult subject matter, but ebbs and flows musically between those polar opposites. Opener “Adore The Sun” is, for example, a dreamy, almost-Beach Boys-esque blast of summer warmth, but is followed immediately by the ragged, raw breakneck punk of “A Random Exercise In Impermanence (The Collector)”. Other examples include the gorgeous, defiant melancholy of “Curly Q” being sandwiched between the spiky, jittery vibes of “Hollow, As You Figured” and “Keep Up That Talk”, or the glowering raw insistence of “Jesus Fucking Christ” preceding “Something Special”, a reworked song about Freddy Kreuger from Gregory’s Jophus solo project that’s been given a kind of 1950s-esque teen ballad reinvention. And then there’s the epic introspection of the aforementioned “Black Mold”, which gives way to the gentle, almost lullaby-esque closer “Baby Blue.”\n“I kind of wanted this album to feel like a car crash,” admits Gregory. “I wanted it to feel like you’re getting whiplash going from song to song.”\n“I think the record as a whole as a journey feels bittersweet hopeful in a way, ending with the very dark Back Mold and I feel a little bit like Baby Blue is something blooming out of nothing after the lowest point of the record.”\nIn other words: we’re all going to die, so we might as well enjoy the ride before we do.\nThat, perhaps, is also reflective of the band’s attitude. This current line-up – cemented when Dasilva joined last year – is, they say, the band’s “forever line-up”. It’s who they’ve always wanted to be and  they’ve made the record they’ve been striving to make since forming in 2014. You can hear that chemistry, that magic, that synergy, all the way through.\n“I feel like this was exactly what we wanted to do exactly how we wanted to do it for the first time,” beams Gregory. “Our heads are all in the same spots, which is probably the first time since we’ve been a band that that’s happened. Everyone in the band wants to be here and we’re all super stoked to be where we are doing this.”\nplus MACSEAL, INSIGNIFICANT OTHER, and CALIFORNIA COUSINS"

The record sold just shy of 2,000 copies in their first week, earning them some impressive debut charting positions amongst hard rock and new artists. In Summer 2017, they embarked on a tour with The Color Morale and The Plot In You. Followed by that tour, they supported a tour with Oceans Ate Alaska and with Ice Nine Kills to close out their year. \nSpinefarm will be releasing a deluxe version of Dreaming Is Sinking / Waking Is Rising in 2018 featuring some stripped down versions of a few tracks and an additional cover track. Catch Dayseeker this summer performing on the Mutant stage on the Vans Warped Tour. \nwith HOLDING ABSENCE, THORNHILL and CASKETS"

Participants will expand their sonic horizons during a free hands-on workshop covering a different synthesis topic each session (drones, sequencing, sound design, etc.), then collaborate on a group jam that will propel the workshop sounds into the beyond! Participants are encouraged to bring their own electronic instrument or use one from the Grand Creative Resource Library (limited availability). Participants can also preview the instruments available from the Library and sign up to borrow one after the session. We have full modular systems, desktop synths and drum machines and a selection of Macbooks, iPads, midi controllers, and audio interfaces. The inaugural session on May 18th will be led by Ryan Smith, who in addition to teaching regular synthesis classes at Gray Area also plays in the band Caribou and makes techno music as Taraval. The workshop begins promptly at 6pm, followed by group jam time beginning at 7pm. There will be time at the end of the workshop for general questions and advice about synthesis. Please arrive in time to set up your instrument(s) before the jam begins.\nThe Grand Creative Resource Library is a lending library offering the tools needed to create electronic music and sound art. Paired with access to workshops, labs, incubators, and events produced by the contributing partners, this collective resource will eliminate barriers to creation at the forefront of art and technology.\n\nThe Grand Creative Resource Library is a collaboration between Crowbar Corner, ZERO1, and Gray Area."

Read more.\nJoin us for this special showing of Gone, Gone Beyond and go behind the screen with creator Vicki Bennett (People Like Us), as she shares her creative process, expanding her aesthetics from 2D to 3D to create audiovisual content which breaks the rectangle.\nUsing collage as a compositional tool opens up endless opportunities to experience results that are more than the sum of the parts, opening doors (and windows) to let light in from outside of our own limited and sometimes repetitive ways of thinking. Since 2016 Vicki Bennett has been creating “Gone, Gone Beyond” for RML CineChamber, an immersive 360 surround cinema environment, is now an hour long. In this presentation Vicki tells us about her creative process, expanding her aesthetics from 2D to 3D to create audiovisual content which breaks the rectangle, smashing the thin screen into tiny fragments, looking beyond the frame, climbing through to see what’s behind. Under the name “People Like Us,” artist Vicki Bennett has been making work available via CD, DVD and vinyl releases, radio broadcasts, concert appearances, gallery exhibits and online streaming and distribution since 1992. Bennett has developed an immediately recognisable aesthetic repurposing pre-existing footage to craft audio and video collages with an equally dark and witty take on popular culture.\nShe sees sampling and collage as folk art sourced from the palette of contemporary media and technology, with all of the sharing and cross-referencing incumbent to a populist form. Embedded in her work is the premise that all is interconnected and that claiming ownership of an “original” or isolated concept is both preposterous and redundant. Most of the People Like Us back catalogue has been available for free online since 2002. For many artists, profit and publicity is more likely through free distribution (the gift economy) than independent publishers and distributors, which often struggle with limited resources. Online self-distribution allows an artist to keep their work available, resolving a tension between label production costs and the desire of an artist for work to be available. UbuWeb generously hosts the discography and filmography of People Like Us.\nGone, Gone Beyond\nThis special screening is part of a limited run showing of Gone, Gone Beyond, an immersive audio-visual spatial cinema work by People Like Us (aka Vicki Bennett). This is Gone, Gone, Beyond's US premiere, following its European debut tour last fall with screenings at nyMusikk in Oslo, the Barbican in London, and more.\nThe work's title and underlying concepts come from the Heart Sutra, a key Buddhist text, describing how all phenomena are empty in form yet ultimately interconnected. The last lines of the Heart Sutra say ‘gate gate pāragate pārasamgate bodhi svāhā’, which can be translated as “gone, gone beyond, gone beyond that a bit more, and then beyond that a bit further”. This reflects perfectly the action of going beyond the frame to where there are no edges to the narrative – just emptiness."

            "title": "FRONT LINE ASSEMBLY",
            "details": "industrial. gothic. ebm.\nall ages.\n$25 advance;\n$35 day of show.\nFront Line Assembly's lead man Bill Leeb is three decades into the industrial scene, so rest assured he knows what he's doing. FLA's body of work ebbs and flows somewhere between industrial, dark dance music, and the apocalypse- with so much musical history there is something for everyone. In the 80s Leeb collaborated with Skinny Puppy before founding FLA (along with a multitude of projects), releasing a ton of music (including video game soundtracks), and touring the globe.\n\nLongtime songwriting associate Rhys Fulber is back on board for FLA's latest electro-industrial record, Mechanical Soul, and listeners will rejoice at the old school, sparse approach. The record is a dark, pandemic-influenced one (for example: a track in German about dying alone) that documents much of the past year spent in solitary while revisiting an old song and beloved rivet themes.\n\nFLA has seen many iterations, with each band member adding to the sound during their stay - but this iteration of Front Line Assembly as a duo happens to be the original one. The electronic body music vibes are woven throughout - likely from having two original members back together. It is no surprise that this record is being embraced by old school rivetheads and new listeners alike. Live, there's nothing grandfatherly about Front Line Assembly - aggressive rhythms, goth metal undertones, pounding drums, Bill Leeb stalking the stage with his mic, and Rhys Fulber manning the synths. Just close your eyes and let these pioneers take you away.\n\nUpon first glance, Rein cuts a devastatingly industrial picture: a Borg-like, futuristic, mechanical being of unknown origin. When you dig deeper, part of the mystery is a revealed - a Swedish girl with a musical family and a penchant for dark electronics, Rein has been genre bending since her 2016 release \"Freedoom.\" Her latest efforts, dub remixes from her debut Reincarnate, was produced by popular German DJ/producer Boys Noize. Rein's music embraces the best of the electronic subgenres, industrial in appearance but with a hard-edge that recalls the EBM of the 80s and the more recent but still a life time ago sounds of early 2000s electroclash like The Rapture. Rein transformed at some point from a typical blonde human into the interesting machine you now see before you, aggressively yelling her truth while owning the stage. Her voice can switch from a terrifying shout to robotic pop music to a sung melody with ease, all of which are a joy to hear.\n\nSynthetix provides a great soundtrack to a robot invasion. He separates himself from others as primarily a hardware based live-PA, fuseing deep banging beats, pulsating synths, booming bass lines, and futuristic effects, with a full onslaught of the senses that will make you want to battle robots, take over the world, and shake your ass."

Stevie Stone has assembled an all star lineup of headliner level acts for this tour.\n\nMere weeks before leaving his hometown of Columbia, Missouri, to attend a junior college in Iowa on a basketball scholarship, Stephen Williams stepped off the stage at his first ever performance and decided to forgo his full ride in pursuit of a career in rap. Sacrificing the security of his collegiate path was a bold leap of faith that led to Stevie's first tour with label mate Tech N9ne in 2009 and eventual signage to Strange Music in 2011. Stevie Stone was signed to Tech N9ne's Strange music for 10 years before leaving to start his own record label Ahdasee Records. Stevie's intense bars married with gravelly melodies have solidified Stevie as a staple in countless nationwide tours.\n\nTwisted Insane raps in the Chopper style of rap, a very fast-paced style that originated in the Midwestern United States, but he also crosses the line into sinister Horrorcore. Often compared to fellow artists Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Twista and Busta Rhymes, he clearly stands out with his own unique style. He has amassed a massive cult following in the dark underground, by those who can appreciate his incredible rapping speed and verbal ability.\n\nLocksmith has been featured on Shade45 and Sway In The Morning several times, and is known as one of the best lyricist and freestylers out there today.\n\nJL B Hood is a Kansas City Native and former Strange Music Artist. He is a billboard charting artist that has collaborated & toured with Stevie Stone.\n\nStaik G is very well known in the underground underground Hip Hop scene, and has done over 30 tours in the last 8 years."
